- Cloud computing before the word was corrupted to mean "remote server". What the "cloud" is today: Storage or processing done on some other computer but accessed via the internet, even a single server in many cases. https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3peb5l/eli5_cloud_computing/cw5zyy7

  - Iaas- infrastructure as a service- you pay for some servers and do whatever you want on them.
  - Paas- platform as a service - you pay for a server with the OS/ Middleware on it and you run your software on top of it.
  - Saas- software as a service- you pay to get everything, servers, o/s, Middleware, and the software.
  - Iaas: you rent a car, you have to get gas, drive it and get groceries from the grocery store.
  - Paas: you take a taxi, and get groceries.
  - SaaS: you pay someone to deliver groceries.
- It's a marketing term for redundant, distributed, server side storage that synchronizes changes with the client side data. It's as new as the pointy stick. https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/j62ec/eli5_cloud_computing_andor_the_cloud/c29gb3f
- This used to be called "hosting", but advances such as virtualization - something that makes a big computer pretend its a bunch of smaller computers (partitioning on steroids), mean that a whole bunch of computers can be on one computer (a server) and a computer farm can be divvied up on demand. https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/j62ec/eli5_cloud_computing_andor_the_cloud/c2aeec4

- a whole bunch of servers/computers, in many different geographical locations, appearing as just one server and connected in such a way that computers can be added and removed instantly and on-demand. This means that instead of having to buy lots of unused servers just in case, you can rent exactly what you need for exactly as long as you need. https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/j2fdi/can_someone_explain_what_cloud_computing_is_and/c28lk7z
- The term "cloud" doesn't mean much to people who actually understand the details of how computers are matched up with customer's programs. It's mostly a word for people, like management, who don't need to understand this stuff just pay for it. https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/39ep0d/eli5_cloud_computing/cs2u19c

  - pay for as much as is needed, when it is needed
  - enables to exactly align technology expenditure with requirements
- Replacing all instances of the word "cloud" with "somebody else's computer" might make organisations stop and think about the security implications of cloud computing. https://www.grahamcluley.com/2013/12/cloud-privacy-computer/
- I thought it was just buzzwords, nothing more than the icon we use to denote "the network".... It's not....  
  By switching your thinking on this, most of the costs of IT infrastructure go away. There are companies saving millions by embracing "the cloud".  
  Which isn't "someone elses computer" but "virtualised data centre".
