## Store other files on time machine disk

1. Connect your external drive connected so that you can see it in a Finder window sidebar.
2. Go to Applications > Utilities > Disk Utility.
3. Select your external drive and containter in the list.
4. On the right side of Disk Utility above the graphs, you'll see a Volume +-. Tap on plus to add the volume. You'll be presented with format and size options. I went with APFS and 10GB to test it.
5. The new volume will be created within seconds, and you can close Disk Utility. You should see it mounted in the Finder window sidebar below your Time Machine volume.
