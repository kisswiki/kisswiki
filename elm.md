    - Regardless of the technical merits of any alternative solution offers, and we are not just talking about Clojurescript, Elm offers a similar set of advantages, the herding effect is powerful. Your investment in Javascript is far more likely to pay off that putting time into one of the alternatives, none of which have momentum. http://rrees.me/2014/01/16/clojurescript-is-it-any-better-yet/
    - it's hard to interface with JavaScript, making libraries such as three.js and pixi.js unavailable https://www.reddit.com/r/elm/comments/3vxxyt/is_elm_lacking_an_assetgame_framework/cxrrier
    - Right now, making use of browser api's isn't as easy as it should be, and interop with external js libraries almost too much work to be worth it (I'm my experience). https://www.reddit.com/r/elm/comments/3y9un5/any_idea_about_how_to_make_mobile_html_apps/cyc6r33
    - SIGNAL HELL. This is the same situation as callback hell. The only difference is that callbacks separate your code at boundaries determined by asynchronous calls, while these signal display functions do it at boundaries determined by the type system. http://langnostic.blogspot.com/2013/06/elm-in-practice.html
    - not-expressive-enough static type systems, because it means that polymorphic code that we're used to easily express in JS, becomes a type error in Elm, due to lack of e.g. rank-2 types http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15490053/what-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-angular-js-vs-elm/15531171#15531171

- port
  - Ports are essentially strictly typed event streams to listen to (Elm to JS) or to push events into (JS to Elm). This means you will need to write some boilerplate-ish code, both in Elm and in JavaScript, in order to pass a message to the other side. So the more JavaScript libraries you need, and the more different kinds of objects you want to pass through, the more boilerplate code you will end up with. http://futurice.com/blog/elm-in-the-real-world

- What differentiate Elm? You may thought its: Haskell syntax, FRP, running in Browser. But these can have any language. Elm differentiates:
  - All mutable state is in the signal graph (foldp)
  - All events enter via the signal graph (elm.notify) - called global event dispatcher
  - External state is provided by single-purpose high-level APIs (Time.fps)  
  [yt > Bret Victor style reactive debugging ‒ Laszlo Pandy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK0vph1zR8s)
- import
  - two ways
    - `import StartApp.Simple as StartApp` and then `StartUp.start`
    - `import StartApp.Simple exposing(start)` and then `start`
- With Elm you're really getting into new (if you have a "typical" HTML/JS frontend dev background) territory. It's a different way to do (and think of) GUI development. You will write in a completely new language – made specifically for creating GUIs in a functional reactive programming way – and ideally you'll never deal (at least not directly) with any of the traditional DOM APIs. Elm comes with a sort of "standard library" that gives you tools to create and manipulate graphics/text/etc through time.  

  Your Elm language code will describe, in a totally declarative way, what you want your GUI to look and behave like as time goes by and events (user input, etc) occur. Then, it will compile it all to HTML/JS/CSS in order that runs on the browser.
