    - The only real change is the use of a stronger 7,000 series aluminium to reduce the risk of the phone bending when sat on in your pocket

  - shockingly Apple has again snubbed the smaller iPhone with the 6S not receiving Optical Image Stabilisation (OIS) like the 6S Plus. Instead it will have to put up with Digital Image Stabilisation (DIS) which should again give the iPhone phablet a noticeable advantage. http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/09/10/iphone-6s-vs-iphone-6s-whats-the-differences/

  - Although the device is not promoted as such, the iPhone 6S has a degree of water resistance due to a change to its internal design, which places a silicone seal around components of the logic board to prevent them from being shorted by accidental exposure to water. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_6S#iPhone_6S_Plus

    - 3d touch - without the need for you to be constantly reaching to the top of the display for the back button
    - Apple's updated its motion co-processor from the M8 chip in the 6 Plus to the M9 in the iPhone 6S Plus, giving you more accurate readings in the Health app, which tracks you steps, flights of stairs climbed and calories burned.
    - jump down half way with a light double tap of the home button
    - I regularly got to the end of the day with around 30% left in the tank, and that included emails, calls, texts, social media, games, music streaming and web browsing throughout the day. Play a game or watch a movie for an extended period of time though and the large 5.5-inch display on the iPhone 6S Plus will start to take a toll on the battery. I ran the techradar 90 minute battery test video on the iPhone 6S Plus, with the screen on full brightness and accounts syncing in the background over Wi-Fi. From 100% the battery dropped to 78% by the end of the video, losing 22% of life in the process. That's an improved showing over the 6 Plus which witnessed a drop of 27%, while the iPhone 6 lost 26%. It appears the A9 processor is a little more power efficient than the A8, and the 6S Plus didn't heat up much during the test.
    - In a bid to save power the iPhone 6S Plus turns off background mail, the always-on Hey Siri command, automatic downloads and some visual effects in the interface. You can turn the function on by diving into Settings > Battery, although it will prompt you to turn it on when you get below 20% juice left. You'll know when you've got low power mode switched on as the battery icon will be yellow instead of green.

    - iPhone 6s Plus fares better than the 6s due to the presence of optical image stabilisation - the two aren't quite at the same level as the likes of Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge and Note 5, which are able to capture more light than any competing smartphone
- ios 9
  - Moving between apps is a lot easier on iOS 9. If an app opens a link in another app, you'll be able to get back to the first app without needing the app switcher. For example, if you open a link in the Messages app, it will open in Safari. To return to the app, just tap the Back to Messages link on the top-left. http://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/features/20-awesome-hidden-features-of-ios-9-741121
  - This is our favourite feature as it breathes new life into old iOS devices. As we reported earlier, iOS 9 brings smoother switching between apps, quicker load times and less lag on devices such as iPhone 4S, iPad 2 and iPad 3. http://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/features/15-ios-9-features-that-make-your-iphone-and-ipad-better-than-ever-740701
