## Pros/Cons

### Pros

> We were previously using RiotJs in our company. We are building huge single page application and recently moved to InfernoJS. Results have been amazing. RiotJs used to BE lagging a lot (It simply could not handle 3000 components in same way) It had really long (50ms) delays everywhere.
> After moving to Inferno following things have improved:
> -We are unit testing components -Performance!!! (No delays/lagging anymore) -es2015 syntax with JSX and inheritance -Intellisense support in IDEs (webstorm) no custom riot syntax - Future proof syntax without worrying low level API changes
> Negative things: -It took for a while to recode all our components in JSX
