## eye tracking

CTO and co-founder Lochlainn Wilson took us through two different experiences designed to show what's possible when VR meets eye-tracking.

In the first, we were tasked with shooting aliens out of the sky merely by looking at them - just like Cyclops from X-Men.

The second demo, while incredibly rough around the edges, was the more exciting of the two. Because the software knows where a user is looking, just like in real life, it focused the images directly where we stared but added blur to the rest of the virtual world, much like the short focal length of a decent camera lens.

## head tracking

Positional tracking - placing stationary sensors away from the user to watch the movement of their head
a mobile VR headset use sensors on the phone to watch the movement of the environment.
But it turns out that achieving this with the precision necessary for virtual reality (‘sub-millimeter accuracy’ as you’ll often hear) is particularly challenging and still considered an unsolved problem.
Oculus and Samsung hadn’t achieved a viable solution by the time they wanted to ship Gear VR.
So Gear VR went out the door with rotational tracking only. Developers have been able to design around this limitation for Gear VR apps quite effectively, but it’s widely agreed that positional tracking would add significantly to the mobile VR experience.

The tracking update rate of the Oculus Rift DK2, meaning the rate at which Oculus’ tracking driver sends different position/orientation estimates to VR applications, is 1000 Hz. However, the time between updates is 2ms, meaning that the driver updates the position/orientation, and then updates it again immediately afterwards, 500 times per second.

## lenses

> If you look at something in the distance the lens does not need to bend a lot.
> That’s also why when you work a lot in front of a computer, you should take breaks at least once an hour and focus on something in the distance. This helps prevent eye strain because it gives your lenses a chance to relax.
> humans have difficulty looking at virtual reality head mounted displays (VR HMDs) that are 3 to 7 cm in front of our eyes. That’s why we need lenses in VR HMDs that bend the light and make it easier for our eyes to see. The HTC Vive uses Fresnel lenses and the Oculus Rift CV1 has hybrid Fresnel lenses to keep the lenses thin and bend the light in a way that helps us to see clearly.

## motion sickness

> Motion sickness has been largely fixed for VR headsets like Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and PlayStation VR thanks to the high frame rate - anything lower than 90fps will make you lose your lunch pretty quickly.
>
> That doesn't mean the problem with nausea has been completely solved. There are still games that require a steel stomach and aren't for the faint of heart. Oculus lists three 'intensity' levels for its library while Steam doesn't say anything at all. We don't know what PS VR's planning but we're hoping it will also display some sort of comfort meter.
>
> Regardless, it's still a subjective struggle which is why we've decided to test out as many games, films and experiences we can to give you an even clearer idea of how sick you might get in VR. Keep in mind, these are all still pretty fun to try and most actually leave you feeling nausea-free - but consider yourself warned about the other titles if you aren't sure how you'll fare in VR.
