## eye tracking

CTO and co-founder Lochlainn Wilson took us through two different experiences designed to show what's possible when VR meets eye-tracking.

In the first, we were tasked with shooting aliens out of the sky merely by looking at them - just like Cyclops from X-Men.

The second demo, while incredibly rough around the edges, was the more exciting of the two. Because the software knows where a user is looking, just like in real life, it focused the images directly where we stared but added blur to the rest of the virtual world, much like the short focal length of a decent camera lens.

## head tracking

Positional tracking - placing stationary sensors away from the user to watch the movement of their head
a mobile VR headset use sensors on the phone to watch the movement of the environment.
But it turns out that achieving this with the precision necessary for virtual reality (‘sub-millimeter accuracy’ as you’ll often hear) is particularly challenging and still considered an unsolved problem.
Oculus and Samsung hadn’t achieved a viable solution by the time they wanted to ship Gear VR.
So Gear VR went out the door with rotational tracking only. Developers have been able to design around this limitation for Gear VR apps quite effectively, but it’s widely agreed that positional tracking would add significantly to the mobile VR experience.

The tracking update rate of the Oculus Rift DK2, meaning the rate at which Oculus’ tracking driver sends different position/orientation estimates to VR applications, is 1000 Hz. However, the time between updates is 2ms, meaning that the driver updates the position/orientation, and then updates it again immediately afterwards, 500 times per second.

## lenses

> If you look at something in the distance the lens does not need to bend a lot.
> That’s also why when you work a lot in front of a computer, you should take breaks at least once an hour and focus on something in the distance. This helps prevent eye strain because it gives your lenses a chance to relax.
> humans have difficulty looking at virtual reality head mounted displays (VR HMDs) that are 3 to 7 cm in front of our eyes. That’s why we need lenses in VR HMDs that bend the light and make it easier for our eyes to see. The HTC Vive uses Fresnel lenses and the Oculus Rift CV1 has hybrid Fresnel lenses to keep the lenses thin and bend the light in a way that helps us to see clearly.

## motion sickness

> Motion sickness has been largely fixed for VR headsets like Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and PlayStation VR thanks to the high frame rate - anything lower than 90fps will make you lose your lunch pretty quickly.
>
> That doesn't mean the problem with nausea has been completely solved. There are still games that require a steel stomach and aren't for the faint of heart. Oculus lists three 'intensity' levels for its library while Steam doesn't say anything at all. We don't know what PS VR's planning but we're hoping it will also display some sort of comfort meter.
>
> Regardless, it's still a subjective struggle which is why we've decided to test out as many games, films and experiences we can to give you an even clearer idea of how sick you might get in VR. Keep in mind, these are all still pretty fun to try and most actually leave you feeling nausea-free - but consider yourself warned about the other titles if you aren't sure how you'll fare in VR.

## resolution

> well, actually the rendering resolution is high, but it needs to be way higher because of how much area there is to cover. A screen only covers a small area of your vision, so it appears much sharper. Once we hit 8k per eye it'll be about on point with 1440p but covering your whole view. Unfortunately, we're going to need insanely faster computers for that day. Here's to hoping it is in the next decade or two.
> Plus, you're ideally hitting a solid 90fps to avoid the unpleasantness that comes with VR at low frame rates. Sub 90, you can get nauseous, dizzy, just all around not a good experience.
> Forget the 8K thing, that's 5-7 years away, minimum. Right now the Vive and Rift display 2160x1200 (1080x1200 per eye). That's approx. 2.6 million px/s. For reference, 1080 res is approx. 2.1 mil px/s. and 1440 res is approx. 3.7 mil px/s.
On a GTX 1080 I can super-sample x2 (double the resolution, then down sample) and get a really nice, crisp image on the Vive. But even at the default x1 sampling, I was able to enjoy most current games on my old 970 without hassle. VR's a different bird altogether. Think of it more as a new alternative way of playing (that fits some genres better than others), rather than a replacement for what we have now.
> if VR headsets rendered only where you look, a tech that now exists for the Vive, the setup above could already hit 8K @ 60fps minimum.

> As someone who owns a Vive, my advice is to hold out for gen 2 or 3 anyways.
Don't get me wrong, it's fantastically fun and they have the motion tracking down flawlessly, but headset resolution and ease of use/fit have much room for improvement.
