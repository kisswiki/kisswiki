Any app can spontaneously steal media key "focus" and the focus doesn't return to the previous app once the thief has finished.

Let's say I'm listening to music via music player app, and I happen to use my web browser to navigate to a web page with a video player. The browser then grabs the MPRIS controls and I cannot control the music player anymore. At least nowadays the music player will re-focus itself if I go to the app and manually pause/play a song with its in-UI controls.

The dumbest thing is the MPRIS keys don't actually seem to control the browser video player, they just stop controlling the music player as well.

P.S. Yes, I have since disabled MPRIS support in browsers.
