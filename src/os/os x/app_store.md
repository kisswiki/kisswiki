As a user, I often go to pains to avoid getting the App Store version of an app, if an alternative exists, because those apps are crippled to such a degree that they aren't worth using.
If I'm using the App Store stuff, then my text editor can't edit all my files, my video player can't open videos when I double-click them, my Evernote can't print to PDF, my disk usage analyzer can't analyze my disk because it can't ask me for authorization to do so, and so on.
