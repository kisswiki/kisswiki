YouTube defaults to serving WebM on Firefox, but on a Mac there is no hardware support for video decoding WebMs like there is for h.264. BUT there is an awesome plugin called h264ify that will force YouTube to use the h.264 codec. I've been running it a while and it stops my fan from kicking on when visiting YouTube.
