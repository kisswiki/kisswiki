## number of maintainers

This whole discussion seems predicated on the assumption that the stats are bad. Has anyone compared them to a comparable project with only about 1000 maintainers?

If anything, the stats tell me our tooling is comparatively amazing. We are getting more done with less people than anyone else.

Iâ€™m basing this mostly on comparing us with the AUR which Repololgy says has 9000 maintainers.
