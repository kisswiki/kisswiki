doas is a minimal replacement for the venerable sudo. It was initially written by Ted Unangst of the OpenBSD project to provide 95% of the features of sudo with a fraction of the codebase.

## machinectl shell

eliasp

I just use systemd's `machinectl shell â€¦` for a proper different user-session whenever I need it and I have this alias as a `sudo su -` replacement since ages:

```nix
environment.shellAliases = {
  msh = "machinectl shell .host /run/current-system/sw/bin/zsh";
};
```

Or of curiosity, why not just `su -` or at least `sudo -i`?

I think `su -` requires you to input the root password. `sudo su -` either requires your own personal password or no password at all. Best practice: you don't know the root password.
