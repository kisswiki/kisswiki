## documentations searcher and video about nix

I found reading code from Nixpkgs to be very valuable as well, and can't recommend it enough. I managed to get by using NixOS without writing my own derivations for several months until I inevitably ran into a need to package something new. Even then, Nix Pills isn't a super useful reference, it's sort of like learning Git by understanding blobs, too focused on details.
Another pain point is looking for documentation of Nix library functions, I've solved this by using Manix[0]

I find nix pills hard to digest since they use the repl, and for a newbie it's hard to see how they apply to real-world packing of something like a python application.
This video helped me a lot though, but unfortunately there are a few minutes of broken audio in the middle [Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Nix (But Were Afraid To Ask) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mG0zM_wtYs)

## process

For packages that have a standard expression format, and the build hasnâ€™t fundamentally changed, they could just update the package doing:

```bash
$ git checkout -b bump-mypkg
$ nix-shell -p nix-update --run 'nix-update <pkg> --commit'
$ nix-build -A <pkg> # ensure it builds
$ git push <fork> bump-mypkg
```

and then create a PR with the bump. It is more involved, but less involved than finding where the nix expression lives, finding the latest version, update version, calculate new sha, building it, making a commit, then pushing to a fork.

For patch bumps, the above code is probably sufficient. For larger changes, there will some nix knowledge needed.
