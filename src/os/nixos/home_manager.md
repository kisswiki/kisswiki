Unfortunately, it is quite possible to get difficult to understand errors when working with Home Manager, such as infinite loops with no clear source reference. You should therefore be comfortable using the Nix language and the various tools in the Nix ecosystem. Reading through the Nix Pills document is a good way to familiarize yourself with them.

That’s interesting, though at the moment I’m relying heavily on my dotfiles and .vimrc to work across Windows, Linux, and macOS, and my vimrc is almost 2k lines long so it may be a while before I try to port that (if ever).

Nix isn’t hard to install in any Linux distro, right? It might be something for me to look into later, if I can run it in Linux, Windows, and macOS. Running inside of Termux for Android (a Debian-like apt-managed environment) might be nice too.
