In my experience GRUB is pretty fragile since it depends on libraries living on /boot to be kept in exactly in sync with the grub EFI/binary you are using. GRUB also uses a configuration file on /boot that is generated by like 3 levels of shell scripts which can sometimes get messed up.

IMO systemd-boot is a lot simpler and less easily broken. You can enable it via the boot.loader.systemd-boot.enable option. It should work with all the normal boot options.
