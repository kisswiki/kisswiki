The "draw on top" hole is a known issue on Android that iOS does not share (since you can't do that on iOS afaik).

Google has several time been tempted to just remove it but since many have legitimate use cases for it that are very popular (like facebook messaging bubble), it has been not been removed fully.

Like it is mentioned in the talk, you need the 'draw on top' permission to do so. The caveat is that apps downloaded from the play store get it by default.
