## 4k

I could not choose 4k when tv was connected when cabel was hdmi2displayport and there was adapter from displayport2hdmi.

`tv | <== hdmi - displayport ==> | <== displayport - hdmi ==> | pc`

I could choose 4k when going only with cabel hdmi2displayport.

Maybe because adapter is in fault?

Maybe this could help https://askubuntu.com/questions/189246/how-set-my-monitor-resolution

## 60 hz

After right-clicking on desktop and choosing `Properties` I could choose 60hz.

## Sound

I could not choose output device displayport in pavucontrol for mpv.

After going to `Gnome Settings > Sound > Output > Choose "HDMI / Displayport 3 - GP104 High Definition Display Controller"` I could choose it in pavucontrol.
