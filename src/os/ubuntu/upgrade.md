## The required dependency 'apt(>=2.1.10ubuntu0.3)' is not installed

> There is no supported release-upgrade path from 20.10 to 22.04, so it's unclear what you did. There used to be a path 20.10 to 21.04 to 21.10 to 22.04, but that path closed when the intermediate releases reached End Of Standard Support. Consider backing up your data and doing a fresh install of Ubuntu 22.04. It's likely to be the fastest and easiest way to get you there. https://askubuntu.com/questions/1485951/trying-to-upgrade-to-ubuntu-22-04-lts-apt-2-1-10ubuntu0-3#comment2602247_1485951

The repositories for older releases that are not supported (like 11.04, 11.10 and 13.04) get moved to an archive server. There are repositories available at http://old-releases.ubuntu.com.

The reason for this is that it is now out of support and no longer receiving updates and security patches.

I would urge you to consider a supported distribution. If your computer is too old in terms of memory or processor then you should consider a distribution such as Lubuntu or Xubuntu.

If you want to continue using an outdated release then edit /etc/apt/sources.list and change archive.ubuntu.com and security.ubuntu.com to old-releases.ubuntu.com.

You can do this with sed:

`sudo sed -i -re 's/([a-z]{2}\.)?archive.ubuntu.com|security.ubuntu.com/old-releases.ubuntu.com/g' /etc/apt/sources.list`

then update with:

`sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade`

To upgrade to a new release:

Once you have performed the above steps to switch to the old-releases mirrors, update the Update Manager and then do do-release-upgrade:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ubuntu-release-upgrader-core
sudo do-release-upgrade
```
