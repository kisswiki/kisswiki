Increase volume above and beyond 100%

Install the extension [volume mixer](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/858/volume-mixer/). Then use the mouse to scroll above the volume icon in the top panel to increase the volume above and beyond 100%.
Adjust volume in smaller steps

By default, pressing the keyboard's volume keys adjusts the volume by 6%. If smaller steps are desired, the shortcut `Shift + Volume Key Up/Down` adjusts volume in 2% steps.
