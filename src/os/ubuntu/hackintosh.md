For the Hackintosh, I recommend you to look at [OSX-KVM](https://github.com/kholia/OSX-KVM). If you care about being able to use your Apple account, use the command line instructions. For some reason, the app store (or any other Apple software that asks for your Apple username and password) fails to work when you use libvirt, but it works fine when you use the command line.
