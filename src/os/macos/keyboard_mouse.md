## Another tester

- Logitech G915 TKL
  - Pros: low profile
  - Cons: Pricy($175 on sale), no pbt keycap, getting oily after several months of regular use.
- Razer Huntsman TKL V2 elite linear switch:
  - Pros: Extreme silent, PBT keycap
  - Cons: Pricy($160), wired, too responsive for typing, can have a lot of typo
- Razer Huntsman TKL V2 elite clicky switch: (I mainly use it for gaming)
  - Pros: Clicky, PBT keycap, 3.5mm total travel distance, 1.5 mm trigger distance. (Extremely good for typing)
  - Cons: Pricy($150), wired, a bit annoying in the meeting because your colleague can hear you typing
- Corsair K70:
  - Pros: linear switches, PBT keycap, $99 on sale
  - Cons: Too responsive with 3.5mm total travel distance and 1.2 mm of trigger distance. Wire.

- The Razer Huntsman V2 boasts some serious features that make it worth considering including:
- Choice of Linear or Click optical switches
- PBT doubleshot keycaps
- Standard bottom row layout so you can use your own keycaps
- 8,000Hz polling rate for reduced latency and good response.
- 2nd generation optical switches with 0/2,s response time
- Padded and comfortable wrist rest with magnetic snaps
- Dedicated media keys and multi-function dial

I've bought this keyboard and i feel like it need more force to actuate the switch, the switch is not as soft as my old huntman elite (both have purple switch) I'm gonna return the V2 because I don't like the stiffness of it. Some people said that it will be come loose in time but I'm not sure about that

Why "for Mac"? It has usb-c <-> usb-c instead of usb-c <-> usb-a. However it does not have usb unifying dongle. "for Mac" can be connected to Windows, although Logitech does not list it as supported on Windows.

## Logitech Mx Master 3

### Pros

gallanonim '

polecam sobie ustawić ten scroll boczny na przybliżanie, działa fajnie

[Warto Kupić Myszkę Logitech MX Master 3 i Klawiaturę MX Keys? Czemu Zrezygnowałem Ze Sprzętu Apple?❌](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4uBz-_yElY)

### Cons

MUSIC VORTEX

I bought the mx master 3 instead of the mm2 and i am now returning it. Although the design, custom buttons are good, the scroll is simply unbearable. It is not smooth at all, and when set to the free scroll option, it reacts to the smallest touch.

Mr Greed's Gadgets

dont understand why every review both written and on youtube fails to mention this. Apple Mac OS has SERIOUS issues with any 3rd party mice. The scrolling, lag when navigating, and connectivity issues (whether bluetooth or dongle) are present in pretty much every model across every major manufacturer (Logitech, Steelseries, Razer). Like you said the experience is not smooth at all. I have the Magic Trackpad 2 but will have to try the Magic Mouse 2 again with some of the Amazon released ergonomic addons to see if that will help the grip situation.

Marcin Wiatrak

Miał ktoś może problem z MX 3, że po sparowaniu z MacBookiem (w moim przypadku Pro M1) myszka nie działa "płynnie"? Ma takie momenty, że przy wolnym przesuwaniu kursor potrafi się w ogóle nie przemieszczać + występują mikro przycięcia przy takim normalnym, codziennym użytkowaniu. Na kompie z Windowsem/Linuxem nie zaobserwowałem problemu

I found a solution! I had it plugged into a usb hub that was fairly close to the computer(5cm) when I had issues with my dongle. Then I took a 3 meter usb cable, plugged one end to my usb hub and THEN plugged the other end to another usb hub, then I plugged the dongle into the second usb hub and voila, works just like a charm. My guess is that there is too much interference when the dongle is close to the computer, as someone else suggested earlier on.

uncertain-ithink

At least for you it works fine fine using the dongle. For me, I don't have problem-free connectivity with the receiver OR bluetooth. So no matter what I do, something will work shoddily. On macOS only. Windows through Bootcamp on the same machine in the same location with the same setup, is fine.

Using bluetooth, the connection is just constantly slightly jerky. But usable. It's easiest to notice that the connection is wonky if I make small circular motions with the mouse. It's hard to make consistently-shaped circles. It like cuts out enough where it elongates the circle or shortens it/cuts corners slightly, etc. But the mouse doesn't disconnect. That's with bluetooth.

When I use the unifying receiver, it works overall, better. But every 10-30 seconds, the mouse will lose connection. The lights on the mouse will turn on as it is trying to find a device to connect to. I will see that it briefly disconnects from LogiOptions.

When I'm moving the mouse across the screen and this happens, the mouse will suddenly slow down and stop, and then JUMP 2-3 times to where it was supposed to go. It actually makes it really hard to get anything done sometimes because it takes so much conscious effort and patience to click things.

This is on a totally clean install of macOS Big Sur.

Use the dongle that came with the mouse, and get the Options+ SW/Driver.

The BT chipset residing in Macs are not capable of EDR, the Logi dongle enables EDR for the mouse. Identical issue with my Wacom Intuos Pro M when using it wirelessly. iMP/Monterey/MX Master 3.

https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/restif/why_is_trackpad_cursor_movement_so_much_smoother/

I read that if you have lag that you should connect the mouse via the USB dongle it comes with and update the firmware from Logitech. Once that is done, you should be able to connect it via Bluetooth again.

https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/pywflf/comment/hex6e6q/

ElectronGuru

2.4 interference is usually the cause. Change your WiFi to 5.0 for at least that mac. Then unplug usb3 devices one at a time. Notice which step fixes it.

UsuallyParrot

For wired Logitech reducing polling rate on mice with the Logitech gaming software worked for me (1000 down to 250, 500 still caused issues)

Hammer_und_Anvil

Alrighty, I'll attempt that but its just weird how this suddenly became an issue after updating to Big Sur. Was all fine in Mojave. I guess Logitech's driver isn't optimized yet?

UsuallyParrot

I think it’s a Big Sur issue, it’s happening with other mouse brands too.

### Logitech G915 TKL vs NumPhy AIR75

I’ve used a G915 TKL for about a year now and purchased the Nuphy.
I used the Nuphy for a few hours before selling it again and going back to the G915. Key issues for me were the flatness was actually really uncomfortable on my wrists even coming from another fairly flat keyboard. Additionally, the keycap shape I felt was quite hard to type accurately on compared to the G915. Finally the Nuphy looked cool and interesting but the ..feel.. when using the board was it felt very cheap and not nearly as solid as the G915. I didn’t expect it to feel as solid given the price difference but the gap in the feel was just too much for me.

## keychron k3 vs nuphy air75

Thank you for showing the lightning problem air75 has.

key caps are not fully interchangeable. Keychron uses proprietary stabilizers for some of the keys and some other keys have different heights. So if you want to customize your keyboard with custom key caps, then avoid K3.

I have to say I like keychron design more. But what's holding me back from buying it is problem with bluetooth. I've read few reviews about k3 and it seems it is pretty frequent problem.

I've used the keychron k8, and I've gotta say, the bluetooth is sluggish af. It usually takes a few seconds to connect.
On the other hand, nuphy's bluetooth connection is excellent so far. Even if it doesn't connect after turning it on, press 2 buttons & connects instantly.

the k3 takes ridiculously long to connect and misses keys sometimes but maybe that is when the battery is low. the connection time is a joke. for the amount of money that it costs it is unacceptable. this can't be called the best. maybe best looking but that is about it. plus, you can barely see the rgb lighting. it steps down in brightness when it is not connected but you can use a trick to bring it up, press fn+end and you have some static bright colors. or white. but still...

I'll never buy a Keychron ever again. My Keychron K3 has overly senstive keys out of the box, Keychron's solution was to tell all customers with same issue to dissamble all their switches and flip the spring inside it, which will take atleast half a day of work, and if you break anything in process, it's your fault. Not the level of customer service expected for how much they are charging.

they even ignored my emails and then posted on their website a "fix" for all of us who had same issues.  
If you google "Keychron K3 brown optical switch is sensitive" you can find the offical fix paga >\_<!

air75 uses 2.4 and Bluetooth, but k3 has only Bluetooth https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/qvvy4z/comment/hm76bbv/

Air75 uses mechanical switches, the K3 you have uses optical switches. They are not compatible. Optical switches are a completely different beast. The interrupt an IR beam, they do not make electrical contact. My K3 is the non hot swap which uses mechanical low profile Gateron switches (the same as Air75). https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/qvvy4z/comment/hr6qfy7/

Air75: The new version of the firmware lets you swap between multimedia and f with the shortcut: FN+TAB+F. I had to go to their discord to find it. https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/qvvy4z/comment/hqg8kbq/

Air75: In regards to the keys, they do feel a bit odd. It's not "loose" in the traditional sense -- lateral movement of the key when the fingers move side to side over them. However, if I put pressure on the edge of a key it will kinda tilt down, as though the switch is not fully "plugged in" to the cap. If you do this to enough keys they will not feel flush with each other as they should be. Its not something that triggers through normal use, though, I only noticed it because I was testing after replacing all the caps.

Yes, that was the feeling I was describing. I think it is a design issue with all current low profile switches...

## ZSE Moonlander Mark 1

With split keyboard your chest is open https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEWiAAMLxd4

The first problem I have with the Moonlander is, mainly due to my small hands, how big it is and how uncomfortable it is to use the thumb cluster. There are four keys on the thumb cluster, and I can only use one/two keys comfortably. The other keys are definitely out of my reach. To reach them, I’ll have to hover my hands entirely from the wrist pad. ZSA recommends articulating the thumb cluster up. But the problem with this solution is that the rest of the key is now totally flat.

If you carefully look above, you’ll see in the picture that my thumb rests just in the middle of the main base key are and the thumb cluster. I need to stretch my thumbs a bit. Stretching is not an issue for medium or large hands, but people with small hands and wrist like mines don’t work well. As a comparison, I used a website that compares various split keyboard designs, and here is an image that shows the difference between Moonlander and Kyria (another popular Split Keyboard):
