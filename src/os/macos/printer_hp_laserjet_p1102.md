## HP driver does not want to install, wants macos 12 or earlier. I have macos 12.2.1

`brew install --cask pacifist`

Go to https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/hp-laserjet-pro-p1102-printer-series/4110394/model/4110303

Choose macos version, download driver, unpack dmg, run `pacifist > open package > select unpacked pkg > install with administrative privilieges > choose not to update files`.

Go to printers, add, select driver for hp laserjet p1102

- you can use the demo version of Pacifist to install the drivers https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253351919?answerId=256270737022#256270737022
