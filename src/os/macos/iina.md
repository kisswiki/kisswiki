You can also bind a key (or combo) to e.g.

Use one button to switch to multiple values : cycle-values speed ".5" "0.75" "1"

Increase current speed with 10% multiply speed 1.1

Set to half the current speed: multiply speed .5

Add / remove from current speed: add speed 0.2 add speed -0.2

(these values are "raw values", see checkbox bottom right in key bindings dialog)
