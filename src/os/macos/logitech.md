For the last 6-9 months I had to keep both my M1 Mini and M1 MBA receivers within six inches of the keyboard and mouse to minimize but not eliminate the periods of choppiness. I installed the latest Logitech Options from here: https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025297893 and it has completely eliminated the chop and the receivers are now 12-18" away from their devices.
