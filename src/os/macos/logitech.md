For the last 6-9 months I had to keep both my M1 Mini and M1 MBA receivers within six inches of the keyboard and mouse to minimize but not eliminate the periods of choppiness. I installed the latest Logitech Options from here: https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025297893 and it has completely eliminated the chop and the receivers are now 12-18" away from their devices.

I managed to fix my BT issues on my M1 Mac mini. Unfortunately I tried so many things that I am not sure which one of them was the fix. Here is everything I tried.
Delete the file com.apple.Bluetooth.plist, from the library, then reboot.
Stop using Wifi and using ethernet instead. (The theory some have is that the wifi interferes with the BT.)
Hold down on SHIFT and OPT then click on the bluetooth icon in the menu bar then select reset bluetooth module.
Reset the SMC.
Sign out of iCloud, reboot, then sign back into iCloud. This fixed my unlock with Apple Watch issue and my wireless sidecar issue.
If you are having BT issues on your M1 Mac I recommend trying those solutions above.
