## Subtitles

MP4 supports more variation in subtitle formats than QuickTime Player does. For QuickTime Player 10 to detect and use subtitles, the format needs to be embedded ‘Tx3g’. You may find that the Subler application does an excellent job with this, as will will import many formats, and convert to the correct format when saving as a new .mp4 file with embedded subtitles.

This will also function well with iTunes and Apple TV.

You can embed subtitles using third party tools, then they will be available through the controller icon or through the menu in QuickTime Player.

E.g. Subler – a macOS app to mux and tag mp4 files. When adding .srt, they will be converted to tx3g automatically, as needed.

QuickTime Player requires embedded subtitles in the MPEG-4 Timed Text / Tx3g format.

If you add subtitles to a QuickTime file with third party app Subler, then it will convert subtitles file to the correct format.
