## Print Screen key - does not work for me - maybe join insider program?

Press Print Screen. You heard it right, just one button! It’s not enabled by default – go to Keyboard Settings – you’ll see a new option that says “Use the Print Screen key to launch screen snipping”. Opening Settings and searching for “print screen” will take you to the right page.

NOTE: After installing this build, please check the Microsoft Store for [Screen Sketch](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/screen-sketch/9mz95kl8mr0l) app updates. You will need an updated version to receive the ability to crop screenshots.
