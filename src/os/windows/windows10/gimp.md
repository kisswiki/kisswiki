## interface size

I have gimp 2.8 on Windows 10 and this is what solved the small tool icons problem for me: open This PC > Local Disc (C:) > Program Files > GIMP 2 > bin, right click on gimp-2.8, open Properties, click on Compatibility. On the settings options select: Override high DPI scaling behaviour. Scaling performed by, scroll and select System, Apply, OK
