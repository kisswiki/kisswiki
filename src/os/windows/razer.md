I need to install Synapse 2

Synapse 3 does not support Death Adder Chroma? https://www.razer.com/synapse-3

When installed Windows 10, there was already Razer Synapse installed but some weird version (Synapse 3 with Razer Central?), that did not detect my mouse.

I have installed Synapse 2 https://support.razer.com/gaming-mice-and-mats/razer-deathadder-chroma/

But keyboard was not visible in Synapse 2. I needed to uninstall other Razer software.
