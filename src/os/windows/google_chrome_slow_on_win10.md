On my computer Chrome ran faster after I stopped Windows from (secretly) acting as a peer-to-peer host for sharing Windows Updates with other computer users on the internet. If you have not heard (and Microsoft isn't up front about this) Windows 10 uses your PC to send Windows and application update files to other machines that need them. Thus Microsoft saves a load of bandwidth by using yours instead. You can turn this off as follows: 

Settings / Update & Security / Windows Update / Advanced Options / Choose How Updates Are Delivered....  Then set the first slider to OFF.
