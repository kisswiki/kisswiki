Use `filter`.

```typescript
this.DetailDS = this.DetailDS.filter((u) => u.id !== id);
```

Because with splice you need to use `toSpliced` to return new array, so that reference changes and angular will detect it.

```typescript
this.DetailDS = this.DetailDS.toSpliced(
  this.DetailDS.findIndex((u) => u.id === id),
  1
);
```

Also be careful when you use splice with indexOf. If indexOf returns (-1), that's to say the element wasn't found, splice will remove the last element of the array (negative indexing works).
