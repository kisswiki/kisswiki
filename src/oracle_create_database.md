> 2 Creating a Database User
> You should create at least one database user that you will use to create database objects. A database user is a type of database object: a user is associated with a database schema, you connect to the database as a database user, and the database user is the owner of any database objects (tables and so on) that you create in the schema associated with the user.

> 2 Creating and Configuring an Oracle Database
> Reasons to create a database after installation are as follows:
> - You used Oracle Universal Installer (OUI) to install software only, and did not create a database.
> - You want to create another database (and database instance) on the same host computer as an existing Oracle database. In this case, this chapter assumes that the new database uses the same Oracle home as the existing database. You can also create the database in a new Oracle home by running OUI again.
> - You want to make a copy of (clone) a database.
