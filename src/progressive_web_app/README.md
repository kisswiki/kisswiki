## About

>YES! We don’t need to look much further back than the desktop/laptop platform to see what happens… web apps and the cloud take over. Almost nobody installs applications anymore, and even the stubborn creative suites and word processing programs have moved off of our hard drives.
It won’t be long before this same thing happens with mobile devices as they get more capable with web views.
One great example of an app done this way is The Financial Times https://ft.com, using local storage to make the experience exceptional.

> Where iOS 11 differs from earlier versions is that the webview content now respects the safe areas. This means that if you have a header bar that is a fixed position element with top: 0, it will initially render 20px below the top of the screen: aligned to the bottom of the status bar. As you scroll down, it will move up behind the status bar. As you scroll up, it will again fall down below the status bar (leaving an awkward gap where content shows through in the 20px gap).
