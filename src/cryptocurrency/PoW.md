While your criticisms are valid, you're criticizing just one implementation of "a blockchain", namely chains secured by CPU-bound PoW. There's plenty of other implementations with different trade offs. You could design your PoW algorithm to be more ASIC-resistent, eg https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/29890/memory-hard.... You could switch to proof of stake. You could use whatever algorithm XRP is using.

Also, by saying "blockchain is a terrible solution", I assume you mean "there are other better solutions [to the problem of creating a decentralized ledger, or whatever]". What are those better solutions?


I agree that bitcoin's use of sha256 nonce seeking is a very easy target for critique. My broader assertion though is that proof of work, by design, will always centralise into a few, one way or another. Other theoretical schemes may be more resistant to centralisation though my instinct is that unless you find some sort of PoW mechanism that strongly anchors to some universal and impossible to simultae physical constraint of the universe we inhabit, POW mechanisms of any economic value will all race towards centralisation shrinking number of signing peers.

Proof of stake at this time is purely theoretical. It lacks strong proof that it solves the problem it sets out to solve. I personally doubt it is a viable solution and my belief it is a dead end avenue of research. Notable there are no large scale implementations yet, even eth rolled back the clock on POS.
