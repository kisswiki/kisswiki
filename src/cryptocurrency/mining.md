Seriously there is a reason that almost nobody on this sub mines and is telling you not to waste your time... The energy required to do it just doesn't make it worth it.

If it was as profitable as you think it is, we would all be doing it. Unless you somehow have access to extremely cheap/ free energy (which I highly doubt since you mention southern IL) it isn't a profitable venture. 5 years ago, yeah maybe. But today, not unless you have millions to invest and access to extremely cheap electricity.

The one way you could maybe (very unlikely though) do it in the U.S. is by investing hundreds of thousands of dollars into small mining shacks in the desert with solar installed. There is a guy who is doing it in the SW. Basically if you had hundreds of thousands to build extremely efficient units devoted to mining you may be able to make your money back years from now at which point you can start thinking about profit. This, of course, would require some serious knowledge to 
do it in a way where you even have a shot at it being profitable.


Take whatever money you were thinking of spending on solar panels and mining hardware and just buy bitcoins instead. Much better expected ROI.


Long story short:
around $700.000 per PH/s
24/7 staff working on the farm
really cheap electricity (ex. like mentioned already the solar installations in the desert may help, but those will cost you additional money)
Break even in around 21 months with 25% maintenance costs
P.S. If the prices on BTC go up, you get to less months before breaking even, if they go down... well you're screwed unless you somehow rearrange into farming altcoins with profit.
