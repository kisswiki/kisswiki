The innovation of Bitcoin's blockchain was that it introduced distributed ledger that didn't require centralized trust.

Bullshit. Blockchain does not build distributed consensus, it's a totally different thing: document timestamping service.

The only thing novel in document timestamping service called blockchain is that it doesn't need trusted third party. That's all. Other than that, we had cryptographic timestamping protocols for some time already.
