A blockchain is at the end of the day nothing else than a distributed database where everyone can run nodes.

The innovation of Bitcoin's blockchain was that it introduced distributed ledger that didn't require centralized trust.

> Blockchain is interesting because it uses that chunked linked list data structure to create distributed consensus.

Bullshit. Blockchain does not build distributed consensus, it's a totally different thing: document timestamping service.

> So it's unfair to just isolate the data structure on its own and say it's not interesting or novel.

The only thing novel in document timestamping service called blockchain is that it doesn't need trusted third party. That's all. Other than that, we had cryptographic timestamping protocols for some time already.

Triple-entry accounting, basically. There was an article on here a few months ago that went into depth on the issue.
Double-entry accounting made it much harder to cook the books (a record of where money is coming from and a record of where it is going). Blockchains store every transaction within the coin itself and are validated by the entire network as valid transactions.

Blockchain is a shit database concept. It's use as a currency is one of its best uses. This idea that blockchains are a good database is an absurd myth. Blockchains are useful specifically for doing distributed consensus, and almost nothing else. Currencies are one of the best applications of distributed adversarial consensus. There are others, but currency is pretty near the top of the list.

The Blockchain is a clever combination of two preexisting concepts: distributed merkel trees, and a consensus algorithm. If you remove one of them, you no longer have a Blockchain, you just have one of its preexisting components.

Here's the core of the problem and also why most of crypto / blockchain technology will go down the drain soon:
Decentralization isn't a business model. The opposite is.

That's it. How you get to any competitive edge in a market is: 1) Be better than your competitors in a field. 2) Own that field and displace everyone else. 3) Extract value.

The Crypto hype happened because a super elegant technical solution (-> Blockchain) that nobody really understands was (and IMHO still is) waiting for a problem met a visionary hippie fantasy of a world of inefficient, evil companies that somehow will be made better by some form of decentralization.

The problem is: There wasn't ever an inefficiency and none of those "huge" competitors has any incentive to leave their market share to someone else. So exactly nothing will happen.

Crypto is nothing more than modern white knight fantasy - in reality all the purpopoted benefits of a blockchain are serious shortcomings. Do you really want a payment that can't be rolled back by a centralized authority because you were defrauded or someone hacked your account? Do you want any kind of accounts for a whole tech-afraid populace that they can't access anymore once they've lost their key?

Most people haven't realized that the current centralization and trust in some large companies and institutions is actually a pretty deep local optimum that will be incredibly hard to displace with something better.

Blockchains were designed to prevent double-spending, and not to solve other problems. Most blockchain enthusiasm is misplaced.
One subjective (but powerful) reason for blockchain implementations, is that we're all human, and our egos want to avoid making someone else's database The Big Platform. Or maybe that's our rational sense (looking at GOOG/FB), we don't want our application controlled by someone else.

This article spells out a few reasons why new categories of securities make sense to implement on a blockchain:

> “Do we need a blockchain for this? Couldn’t this be done with a database?” The answer is yes, some of it could be done with a centralized database, but it begs the question “why hasn’t it already been done?” The answer is that the current centralized solutions for electronic value transfer lack compatibility — they don’t talk to each other. I can’t send value from PayPal to Venmo, or from E*Trade to RealtyShares. These layers aren’t interoperable.
