A blockchain is at the end of the day nothing else than a distributed database where everyone can run nodes.

The innovation of Bitcoin's blockchain was that it introduced distributed ledger that didn't require centralized trust.

> Blockchain is interesting because it uses that chunked linked list data structure to create distributed consensus.

Bullshit. Blockchain does not build distributed consensus, it's a totally different thing: document timestamping service.

> So it's unfair to just isolate the data structure on its own and say it's not interesting or novel.

The only thing novel in document timestamping service called blockchain is that it doesn't need trusted third party. That's all. Other than that, we had cryptographic timestamping protocols for some time already.

Triple-entry accounting, basically. There was an article on here a few months ago that went into depth on the issue.
Double-entry accounting made it much harder to cook the books (a record of where money is coming from and a record of where it is going). Blockchains store every transaction within the coin itself and are validated by the entire network as valid transactions.

Blockchain is a shit database concept. It's use as a currency is one of its best uses. This idea that blockchains are a good database is an absurd myth. Blockchains are useful specifically for doing distributed consensus, and almost nothing else. Currencies are one of the best applications of distributed adversarial consensus. There are others, but currency is pretty near the top of the list.

The Blockchain is a clever combination of two preexisting concepts: distributed merkel trees, and a consensus algorithm. If you remove one of them, you no longer have a Blockchain, you just have one of its preexisting components.
