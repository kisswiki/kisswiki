Ethereum Wallet and Mist share the same source repository (https://github.com/ethereum/mist). Mist is a wallet enabled browser, and "Ethereum Wallet" is Mist but with the browser capability disabled, so you can use it as a wallet. I don't know about recent version but at some point you were able to switch between them with a command line option.

MIST and Etherum Wallet is two sides of the same thing. MIST is a DApp browser, and Etherum Wallet is also a DApp browser, but can only show one DApp, - the ethereum wallet DApp.
