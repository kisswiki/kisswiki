  - I've put together a small "starter kit" lib that's intended to simplify some of the process around setting up a Redux store [0]. We do include redux-thunk by default there, as well as Immer for simplifying immutable updates in reducers. It's still a personal-scoped package atm, but longer-term we'd like to make it an official Redux-branded addon. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16812346
