If you have another PC you can/should use an external SPI chip flasher, maybe with a SOIC clip of the right size if you can't remove the chip.

If you are talking of your AM1 system then the chip is removable afaik.

An extremely cheap flasher supported by flashrom (0.9.9 and later) is " CH341A", just look for that on ebay.

Having an external flasher also allows you to recover or reflash stock firmware in case of issues (and the board does not boot). This is VERY important because Coreboot is not guaranteed to work and to be 100% good for you. In most cases you will have some kind of issues.
