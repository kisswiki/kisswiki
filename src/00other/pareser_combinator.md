Parser combinator libraries like Parsec in Haskell provide a nice alternative. You essentially write down something very close to a formal grammar of the format you want to parse, and out of this comes a parser for the format. Other than parser generators like good, old yacc, everything is written in target language though, and there is no separate code generation step
