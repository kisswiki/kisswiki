## General suggestions for integrations:

- To replicate data between Salesforce and Heroku, use Heroku Connect.
- To expose a Heroku Postgres database to Salesforce, use Heroku Connect External Object.
- To proxy OData, SOAP, XML, or JSON data sources into Salesforce, use Salesforce Connect.
- If Heroku Connect doesnâ€™t fit the bill, like when you have a custom UI on Heroku where users log in via Salesforce, use the Salesforce REST APIs.
- To offload or extend the processing of Salesforce data events, use callouts from Salesforce to Heroku.
- To embed a custom UI from Heroku (or other external web app) into Salesforce, use Canvas.

## Errors when creating mapping for Contact object

When enabling Streaming API:

```
Unable to create mapping Contact in connection #6ebf2ab9-5777-4dbe-93dc-0aaf4fb315a1. {"code":"badconfig","message":"PushTopic check failed: Server raised fault: 'INVALID_TYPE: \n FROM PushTopic\n ^\nERROR at Row:2:Column:22\nsObject type 'PushTopic' is not supported. If you are attempting to use a custom object, be sure to append the '__c' after the entity name. Please reference your WSDL or the describe call for the appropriate names.'"}. Status code: 400 (HTTPError: error)
```

When enabling Write to Salesforce:

```
Error:Read-write mappings require an upsert field for syncing. Upsert fields must be defined as unique External ID fields in Salesforce.More Info...
Warning:Fields needed for insertion to Salesforce need to be mapped: LastName
```

the problem might be with Professional Plan:

>Only the following editions support BigObject: Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer. If you are using an edition other than these (such as Professional) you won't be able to use FieldHistoryArchive.
