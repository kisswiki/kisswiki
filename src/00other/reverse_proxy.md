a proxy is where you have a computer look at web pages remotely and it then will send that web page to you https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/yhyzv/comment/c5vs6vi/

similar to proxy war. someone else is fighting for you.

traffic goes from you to proxy to target.

with reverse proxy traffic comes to proxy and is redirected to computers.
