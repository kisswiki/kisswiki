- ACME https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Certificate_Management_Environment
- standalone stops server, webroot does not, nginx plugin reloads server `systemd reload nginx`, so it is a graceful shutdown.
- with nginx plugin, for every domain there will be nginx reload.

## Challenge

The HTTP auth works like this:

- Certbot places a file in a directory
- Then a remote server tries to fetch that from .well-known/acme-challenge/<filename>
- If it is successful, you proved ownership of the domain and get the certificate

Renewals are treated specially: they donâ€™t count against your Certificates per Registered Domain limit, but they are subject to a Duplicate Certificate limit of 5 per week
