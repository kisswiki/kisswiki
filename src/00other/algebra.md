"Algebra" is derived from al-jabr, one of the two operations he used to solve quadratic equations https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_Musa_al-Khwarizmi

Algebra (from Arabic "al-jabr" meaning "reunion of broken parts"[1])

Elementary algebra differs from arithmetic in the use of abstractions, such as using letters to stand for numbers that are either unknown or allowed to take on many values.

In its most general form, algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols
