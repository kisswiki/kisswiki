>In lambda calculus and functional programming, currying is defined as taking a function that takes multiple arguments and converting it into a sequence of functions that each take a single argument.
>The act of applying arguments to the functions in this way is called partial function application.
>Elm actually supports currying by default

>Partial application occurs when we call a function and pass it a fewer number of parameters than the number of parameters that that function expects.
