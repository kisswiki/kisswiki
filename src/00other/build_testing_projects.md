> TC: I love the project. Why did you do it?
> Jeroen: The intro to the article basically states that already: I had a Raspberry Pi and I wanted to get familiar to how it works. Itâ€™s a great tool to have in your toolbox: need a powerful controller running a standard OS for your robot / Internet-controlled doorbell / Twitter-based death ray? Just get one of these for a few quid. Knowing how they work means I can put them to work much faster the next time, which may come in handy if I actually try to make something useful.
