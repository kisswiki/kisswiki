I am very much an imperative programmer and I like how things actually execute, rather than trying to make it elegant looking code. https://youtu.be/CCxjt-dOL0U?t=499

Finally, I personally despise the functional programming style that uses lambdas everywhere. I find it very difficult to read and maintain code that makes heavy use of inversion of control flow. By not accepting this proposal, Zig will continue to encourage programmers to stick to an imperative programming style, using for loops and iterators.
