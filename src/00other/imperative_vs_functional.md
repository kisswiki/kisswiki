I am very much an imperative programmer and I like how things actually execute, rather than trying to make it elegant looking code. <https://youtu.be/CCxjt-dOL0U?t=499>

Finally, I personally despise the functional programming style that uses lambdas everywhere. I find it very difficult to read and maintain code that makes heavy use of inversion of control flow. By not accepting this proposal, Zig will continue to encourage programmers to stick to an imperative programming style, using for loops and iterators.

I do not think functional programming is the proper model for programming. I think it can be a useful way to think about subsets of a program, but it is not appropriate for large-scale work.
