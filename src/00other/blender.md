blender is excellent for 3d animation and modelling (i WAS a hardcore Maya user before autodesk). since 2.5 the UI is adequate but before that it was terrible. i prefer using blender over any other 3d application.
a single caveat to blender is the sculpting, in that blender has a problem managing the triangles at large volumes unless you have an alien supercomputers, so i recommend

@coboenea5 Blender has become an incredible tool and left 3dsMax in the dust in both capabilities and stability. I work as a 3D artist professionally 10+ years and my opinion about Blender went from "it's ok I guess" to "why would you use anything else for general 3D work?".

The industry is gravitating towards it for a reason. It's also gravitating towards Houdini. And Zbrush is already a standard for sculpting (Blender is slowly, but persistently trying to chase it as well). What is certain is that the industry is gravitating away from 3dsMax and Maya. The decades long deals that held Autodesk Software as the Standard since the nineties are ending. Students are doing their projects in Blender despite having access to free autodesk software. There are literally tens of times more information, tutorials and plugins you can find for Blender than for any Autodesk Software. If you want to be relevant in this decade, you will have to catch up and leave old habits behind, my friend.

Blender have improved significantly these past 2 years but it's faaar from being an alternative to 3ds Max or Cinema 4D... it's great if you're producing a personal portfolio but it's not ready for prime time just yet.
Current limitations include:

- Poor particle system. Everything node is still a WIP
- Questionable Mocap support. No retargeting/redirection
- Zero NURBS and Spline support
- Python API still not matured yet
- No Script listeners
