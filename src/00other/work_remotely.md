The most important habit when working remotely from home is to mentally trigger a beginning and an end of the work day. It’s easy to sit in your PJs or sweats all day just because you can, but it will likely backfire in the long-run.

To make this more concrete, here’s my current daily schedule:

- 07:00: Wake up
- 07:05: Reading (Sharpen the saw from The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People)
- 08:00: Check in with the team
- 08:10: Exercise + shower
- 09:30: Start of my work day
- 19:30: End of my work day
- 23:00: Bedtime
