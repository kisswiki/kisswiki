>Honestly, I love what IPFS does but I dislike how it does it. It seems very re-invent-the-world-y, and I'm not convinced that's necessary. The daemon is also very heavyweight and can be very slow with no terribly good tools . It needs a dedicated server process per machine, that server is resource intensive, and administering it is a pain. It's far from a plug-and-play solution. :-/

Make IPFS better -- Tried this, it's very difficult to get into the massive and poorly-documented codebase.
