I am talking about bugs in bache, the block caching layer that has been in the mainline kernel for years, NOT about bcachefs.

As it is there are still rare, data corrupting bugs in bcache. Also many occasions where it bugs out and you have to reset a device, or cannot mount one anymore without the cache drive present.
