Alternatively, stop using antivirus. The amount of stuff that gets flagged as false positives is incredible once you go outside of the applications written by big corporations and the like. It's almost as if they use a whitelist...
Also, seeing that some AV will alert on even the presence of an empty folder that happens to share the same name as actual malware[1] or a completely innocuous Hello World[2][3], it's hard to recommend any. That and the detection of cracks and keygens (which goes beyond "antimalware", IMHO) further strengthens my opposition against what is essentially censorware.
