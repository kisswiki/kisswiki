## The most important status codes for SEOs

- HTTP Status Code 200 - OK
- HTTP Status Code 301 - Permanent Redirect
- HTTP Status Code 302 - Temporary Redirect - Using 302s will cause search engine crawlers to treat the redirect as temporary, meaning that it may not  pass along the link equity that the magical 301 does.
- HTTP Status Code 404 - Not Found
- HTTP Status Code 410 - Gone
- HTTP Status Code 500 - Internal Server Error
- HTTP Status Code 503 - Service Unavailable
