## Upload a file via POST request

The two examples here send a CSV file to the Postman Echo API in a POST request. In the body of the request, you can attach a file in one of two ways:

1. In the request body, click "form-data", hover over the "key" input field, and find the hidden dropdown that says "Text". Click "Text", and then change it to say "File". In the "Value" field, click "Select File" and select the file to send via the POST request body.
2. Click "binary" and then click "Select File" to attach your file.
