i think if i had realized this about 10

years ago i'd be in a much much better

place now i have learned a lot after 14

years of developing software

professionally including five years at a

fan company i'm confident that you will

absolutely disagree with some of these

things i'm also confident that you'll be

surprised by some of them and i'm also

cautiously optimistic that you'll agree

with some of them that said i'm really

hoping that lesson number 15 won't be

about posting this video

## it's better to rebuild something five times than to spend a month talking about how to build

it there's a famous

story about a high school ceramics

teacher who conducted a pottery contest

where one team of students was told that

the criteria for winning was making the

best quality pot and the other team of

students was told the winner would be

the group that makes the most pots

irrespective of quality the team focused

on quality spent all their time

carefully trying to make the perfect pot

while the second aimed to crank out as

many pots as possible in the end the

group focused on optimizing for quantity

actually wound up making the pot of the

highest quality

which was a byproduct of getting so much

practice from making so many pots now i

have no idea if this test actually

happened

but it seems plausible and the moral is

very clear repetition and failure is the

key to success

not extensive study personally i think

this concept applies directly to

software development it's far better to

build something quickly realize it's

wrong than rebuild it than to sit in a

conference room for weeks with everybody

waving their hands around arguing about

the best way to build something because

even though you may throw away the first

and second iteration of the project

you still retain the skill improvements

you got from building them and the third

iteration is going to be far better than

it would have been if you had decided on

that approach before starting to write

code

## feel gratitude when helping others

it's

pretty much guaranteed that there will

be times in your career when you are the

subject matter expert on a system and

someone else is trying to learn that

system so they can be an effective

contributor or maybe you've been

assigned to mentor somebody that is

completely new to the industry so you

have to teach them the basics these

people are gonna have a thousand

questions and you're probably gonna have

to take tons of time away from your own

projects to help them out in this

situation it's really easy to feel

frustrated and become so concerned about

the time displaced from your own

projects that you become resentful but

the reality is helping someone else is

far more rewarding you're in a position

to establish rapport and trust with that

person which has a cascading effect that

can be far more valuable than the

individual work you would have

accomplished with that time conventional

wisdom says the person being helped

should feel gratitude but i think the

person doing the helping should feel

just as much if not more

## be proactive about getting the project you want

getting a project you're not

passionate about can lead to months of

boredom and pain

what's even worse is that somebody else

might have been passionate about your

project but got stuck with a project

that they didn't like

if everybody is being silent about what

they truly want to work on in an effort

to not rock the boat

it can actually be a detriment to the

whole organization of course there will

be times when you have to work on

something you're not passionate about

maybe because nobody wanted to work on

it and you drew the short stick but

there's no harm in being vocal about

which projects you'd be passionate about

working on and do not accept that all

the quote unquote cool projects will

inevitably go to the more tenured

engineers and that you just have to wait

your turn if you're in an organization

that subscribes to this mindset know

that there are better options out there

engineers that are passionate about what

they're working on are a huge tailwind

for the organization

## have a low tolerance for job dissatisfaction

it's really easy to talk

yourself out of changing roles

maybe you convince yourself that things

aren't that bad or that you just need to

work harder to get to a better place

personally when i look back on times i

was dissatisfied with my job i always

talked myself out of making a change for

way too long before actually making that

change the reality is that the job

market for software developers is so hot

that there's no reason to tolerate much

dissatisfaction and there's usually very

little risk in making a change making

changes can also help you distinguish

between having skills that need

improvement and situations where the

expectations for a role might be

unrealistic because that distinction is

really hard to make if you haven't

worked in a few different roles

## prioritize your connections to coworkers over getting your work done faster

obviously there might be exceptions to

this when you're putting out fires but

ultimately investing in a better

relationship with your co-workers is

more valuable for the long term than

getting that story or project completed

a little bit faster establishing a good

relationship with your coworkers not

only makes coming into work more

enjoyable but it can also make design

reviews and code reviews go much

smoother when you have that

pre-established foundation of trust to

stand on

## treat your co-workers code reviews as your own

as a coder viewer there

sometimes tends to be a massive

unwarranted bias toward requesting

changes instead of getting code pushed

through faster the coder viewer usually

feels accountable for the quality of the

code but i've noticed they seldom feel

accountability to the timeline for which

that change is delivered and often view

timeline constraints as the author's

problem instead of one that they need to

be cognizant of now obviously if there

are bugs in a code review point them out

but if you're pointing out something

that's less critical

just provide that context in your code

review comment you can say something

like this issue is minor don't let it

hold up the project

up to you whether you'd like to

implement it i think doing this can

dramatically improve team cohesion

without sacrificing any code quality

## make sure your co-workers feel heard in design reviews or code reviews

your

teammates might suggest approaches that

you've already considered thoroughly and

ruled out it's really really easy to get

dismissive because in your mind the

approach they suggested is just so

obviously wrong but in reality it might

not actually be obvious

it just seems that way to you because

you've spent so much time thinking about

the problem make sure to highlight the

merits of their ideas even if in the end

they don't make sense to implement and

to build on that make sure you're

open-minded enough to really truly

consider their ideas

sometimes it can be hard to truly

honestly consider a new approach when

you've been focused on what you think is

the correct approach for so long either

way simple things like taking notes on

feedback you get and sharing it after

the meeting can go a long way in making

your teammates feel heard

## don't eat alone

it can be tempting

especially for us introverts to come up

with excuses as to why we can't go get

lunch with our coworkers maybe there's a

looming deadline you need to hit maybe

you'd rather watch youtube or maybe

socializing with people you don't know

very well is uncomfortable for you set

aside the discomfort or whatever it is

and go eat lunch with them in the long

run that rapport you establish with your

coworkers will be far more valuable than

whatever you'd otherwise be doing during

that hour

## give fang a try

we're talking about

working for facebook amazon apple

netflix or google ideally early in your

career i'm probably going to get some

heat for this one but working for a fan

company or even just attempting to get a

job at a fan company by studying for the

interviews

can pay off massively and not just in a

monetary sense folks like to criticize

the interview process

but personally i felt like studying for

fang interviews made me much better at

problem solving especially in situations

where massive scale is involved now

there are really smart and motivated

people at most companies but it's really

crazy how smart and motivated the

average engineer at a fan company is

almost everyone is really bright and

extremely motivated and there are very

very few exceptions being in that sort

of environment can be really inspiring

and that being around those sorts of

people and watching them excel can

remind you that you're capable of much

more than what you previously thought

you were capable of i think if i had

realized this about 10 years ago i'd be

in a much much better place now note

that i said give fang a try not work out

a fang for your entire career even if

you don't wind up working for a fang i

guess the broader takeaway here is to

surround yourself with people that do a

better job than you if you're the most

capable person at your company you're

probably going to start thinking you're

amazing which will make you complacent

and you'll probably stop improving if

you do wind up working for a fan company

and you feel it's not a good long-term

fit don't feel like you're downgrading

by going somewhere you feel is more

interesting

## don't be afraid to take time off

now i'm

not necessarily talking about using

vacation time i'm talking about

literally quitting a job so that you can

do something else for a while whether

that's something recreational or maybe

to pursue a business idea of course you

need to have the savings to support

doing this but i feel like the lack of

savings isn't always the thing that

stops people from doing it there's a

completely irrational stigma around not

having a 9-5 job namely that you'll be

considered lazy you'll lose your career

momentum or maybe that you won't be able

to find another job because you have a

gap on your resume with respect to

laziness

i think the folks thinking they need to

miss out on doing something they love

for the sake of their jobs are the ones

that are being complacent as for losing

career momentum i can't see that

happening if you strive to continue to

build your skills during your time off

and finding another job at the time this

video is being made the job market is

way too hot to be worried about that

i've literally never seen evidence that

the gaps on my resume have been an issue

plus if you left your job on good terms

you can probably just get rehired there

if you want to be

## promotions don't come from programmin skills

as an extremely introverted

person that just wants to sit alone and

write code most of the day this was

probably one of the most bitter pills i

had to swallow while it's true that you

need to be a very proficient programmer

to move up the career ladder there's a

bit of an upper bound in how far you

need to go in terms of career

progression

there's a really steep diminishing

return once you go beyond a certain

skill level at coding once you get to a

certain level companies begin to value

other things more like interpersonal

skills the ability to debate others

about high-level architecture and

getting groups of engineers to agree on

the best way to do something getting

better at these things can be much

harder than getting better at coding

and many companies value them

accordingly

[Music]

## don't work on the weekend just for career advancement

sure if you're super

passionate about what you're working on

and it gives you immense joy go ahead

and sometimes your projects might need a

little extra throughput to meet a

deadline but don't do it just because

you want to be perceived as a great

performer most people will have a career

that lasts around 40 years

there's plenty of time to achieve your

career goals and you can't just wait

until your career ends to pursue

everything else that you want in life

maybe take that weekend trip instead of

getting ahead on your projects

## make your career goals known to your manager

it's really easy to fall into

the trap of feeling like talking about

your next promotion will make you sound

entitled especially in the very

beginning of your career psychologically

it's really hard to bring up promotion

when at the same time you're struggling

to learn a team's systems

suffering from imposter syndrome or

maybe racing to fix some production

issue but the reality is that part of a

manager's job is to see that you succeed

in your career and if they aren't

bringing it up you need to be discussing

the gaps between where you are today and

where you need to be to get that

promotion is critical to staying on the

right path without doing that you can

potentially be focused on the wrong

thing and not even realize it

## technology decisions aren't always dependent on the use case

this one is

really hard to implement especially in

bigger companies that obsess over data

and metrics i personally think that

greenfield projects are the most

exciting part of a software development

career and part of that excitement comes

from the ability to choose the languages

and frameworks that you're going to use

one of the biggest factors that usually

plays into this decision is what your

team and organization already use which

might be what you and your teammates are

most familiar with another factor is of

course the technology that is deemed to

be the best for the task at hand it's

this latter concept that i sometimes

object to often when you're making these

choices you're usually not choosing

between two completely different tools

like a hammer and a saw sometimes you're

choosing between two different brands of

hammer it's really hard to objectively

qualify

why one brand of hammer is better than

another it really comes down to

individual preference and which hammer

makes you more inspired to get up and go

hammer some nails in the morning for

example the react and the svelte

javascript frameworks aim to fill almost

the exact same need it's usually

pointless to argue whether react or

svelt is objectively better for project

a i think that i'm excited to try it or

i really enjoy working with it is a good

rationale for choosing a technology like

this as long as a sentiment is shared by

the majority of the team and the

community around the technology is

relatively healthy now of course there

are some broad technology decisions that

are extremely dependent on the use case

like choosing between a sql and nosql

database but after making that broader

decision choosing the specific database

starts to be more about what the team is

excited about and enjoys working with

than the use case itself

so that's 14

hard lessons i've learned in 14 years as

a professional software developer i'm

really excited to learn hard lesson

number 15. if you know what that should

be please let me know in the comments

also let me know what you thought of

these 14 things thanks for watching and

we'll see you in the next one
