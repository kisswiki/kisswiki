Subtitles with .txt extension in 0.24.0
Since version 0.24.0 subtitles with .txt extension are no longer recognized as subtitles and thus no longer autoloaded. Please refer to the offending commit's message and this [upstream issue](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/commit/50991fac81eb56bc0985af2c9d31cd503302dcfe) for more info.

If you want to restore the previous behaviour, use the following Lua script: autoloadtxt.lua.
