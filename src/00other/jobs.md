I recommend accepting this scenario, which can mean a few practical things:

- play the numbers game - multiply search efforts, become desensitized to rejection
- be within the first applicants (you should apply the same day of the job posting, the earlier the better)
- have a few distinct (but truthful) CVs and cover letters. Never skip a letter. I have a Clojure, Ruby and a Java profile
- show recent, hard work - anything from OSS to a personal project (especially with AI) - important IMO to stand out
