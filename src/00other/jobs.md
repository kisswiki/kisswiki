## how to get a job

The reality is that PDF resumes are dead. There are too many applicants for you to stand out that way if you don't already have some kind of "in" like knowing someone at the company.
So what can you do? You can create targeted websites like suggested in the article, but that takes a long time and likely isn't worth the effort. I've gotten ignored many times doing this.

Here's what has worked best:

1.Skip the resume even if the company insists on it.

2. Find the hiring manager's email (or anyone involved in hiring)

3. Send a well put together cover letter email selling your skills with concrete links to projects you can show. GitHub, Codepen, Blog links work very well here.

Here's a blog post focusing on remote jobs that I put together that goes into more depth in case you're interested: https://remoteleads.io/blog/proposals-that-win-remote-freelance-clients/

Why does this work? You're reaching an real human and have a higher chance of getting looked at for your skills instead of getting your resume scanned by a resume-reading machine. This works well when you don't already have connections with the company.

Easy - don't play the game.
I never apply for a job blind or through an applicant tracking system. I always use local recruiters that I've nurtured relationships with.

I also don't negotiate salary. I know my market and tell the recruiters up front how much I want to make. They don't waste my time submitting me to companies where I am above the salary range.

## cover letter and resume (cv)

A cover letter should usually not be about your skills, but rather reasons why you want to work a specific place and more commonly personal stuff.
Skills, projects etc. are for your resume (CV)
