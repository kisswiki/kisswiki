FIDO2 is working, but I wouldn't call it "golden" at all.

Tying authentication to a single device you can lose, especially one controlled by the device vendor not by yourself, sounds highly risk prone to me.

As far as I'm aware, this is not yet a solved problem with WebauthN or FIDO2 standards - they simply recommend that you provide another authentication method or backup device for recovery, and leave it to you to figure out. (If I've got this completely wrong, I'd love to know.)
