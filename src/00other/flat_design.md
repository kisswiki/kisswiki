The experiment was not 'flat' vs 'not-flat'.

It is weak-signifiers vs strong-signifiers.

They have a hypothesis that states that users will be able to accomplish their task with less effort given strong signifiers.

They tested the hypothesis with two versions of the same page: one with weak signifiers and the other with strong signifiers. Both versions were created to _test_ the hypothesis. To either confirm or disprove the hypothesis.

They measured user eye movement activity and produced heat maps.

The heat maps confirm their hypothesis. With weak signifiers the users spent more time searching for the elements they wanted.

How is this not scientific?

Like all good science the conclusion is not 'flat bad, skewmorphism good.'

No, it says whatever you are doing ensure you provide users with signifiers.

So the final result is not a false dichotomy of flat vs non-flat but a useful set of guidelines: "Early pseudo-3D GUIs and Steve-Jobs-esque skeuomorphism often produced heavy, clunky interfaces. Scaling back from those excesses is good for usability. But removing visual distinctions to produce fully flat designs with no signifiers can be an equally bad extreme."


Flat interfaces are nearly unusable for the seniors in my life. Below is a list of UX issues my live-in seniors have regularly, and that they DO NOT learn their way out of. Not specifically flat based, but these changes have been amplified by the flat/minimalist redesigns.

1.Icons are only useful for users that already know what they do. Zero value UX wise for new users. Labels matter, especially on mobile where hover is not an option. Having a "walkthrough" on first load is not a replacement. Also, non-native users do not know about hover tooltips, and they will not learn that behavior, they find them almost exclusively by accident.
2.Gradients on mobile, especially with power save, make apps and pages unreadable for everyone, but especially seniors.
3.Hamburgers and triple dots are not visual indicators for non-native mobile users.
4.Swipe is not an replacement for any UX process for non-native mobile users.
5.Canceling/backing out of any workflow is rarely obvious on flat/minimal designs. Seniors click/tap the wrong thing ALOT. Some giant percentage of their time is spent trying to reverse an action.
6.Zoom is king. Non-button looking buttons get even worse if you remove their context. Mouse over only context buttons might as well be invisible.
7.Seniors do not know what blue/purple/green text means. The underline is the only thing my seniors understand. Also, they click pictures, all pictures, because they are the only thing on these apps/pages that actually look like they are clickable.(see number 6 buttons)
