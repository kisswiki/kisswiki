# Google

## History

> PageRank meant the system was less easily gamed and produced higher quality results. The real magic was combining that with their revolutionary data center operations and being able to treat a whole lab of machines as a single device which ran via map/reduce.
> The clean design helped as well but it was incremental. Google's advantage was that they produced better results faster with lower operating costs. Better and faster were good for customers. Then the rollout of relevant ads meant that Google could turn a profit even at lower cpm than competitors and their ads didn't have to be intrusive or distracting. The combination put them on much surer footing than their competitors so they kept growing, increasing revenue and profit while their competitors struggled.

## How to change from google.xx to google.com?

I usually get redirected to http://www.google.co.nz

However, typing "/ncr" after the address takes me to that site with no redirection

## ad publishing

I am currently struggling with Google and been even considering just straight up creating a Brazilian "Yandex/Baidu" clone or something somehow.

My current business is heavily Google reliant, and Google been proving to be a very poor business partner:

- Keeps punishing my site both in organic rank and AdWords rank (thus price) for not being mobile, despite my site being intended to be viewed by engineers with big screens.

- They remove frequently whatever features they had to avoid wasting money, the one that offended me the most is that I can't anymore advertise on mobile websites unless I also allow apps too, and apps are purely fraudulent clicks, babies don't buy industrial parts...

- Google refuses to take care of fraud, I've visited the top sources of clicks on my display campaigns and there was comments for example on store pages explicitly complaining it was pure fraud, and Google does nothing about it (example: one source of clicks was a flashlight app on Android that opens ads whenever the user turns the flashlight on, clicking the ad is only way to turn it off again)

- Google often randomly stop my ads and search because bogus reasons, requiring me to call them to fix it.

- They removed from AdWords interface the max click price when the campaign is in automatic mode, in the past this was very useful to find out if their AI was bugged (like one time it insisted on setting max cpm to 0.01 despite average cost until that day being 1.20...) or oberpricing me (charging ludicrous prices per click)

Their product (ad publishing, not search) is crap, but they have literal Monopoly, all other ads publishers I tried gave me almost zero clicks...

## [Why Most Google Employees Quit After 1.1 Years (On Average)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZCfP13twxk)

- [x] The perk trap
  - you stay hour longer because of lunch included
- [x] Endless work pressure
  - due to these deadlines they always felt behind schedule
- [x] Difficult to survive
  - 3 mln people apply for job at google yearly
  - landing job at google is 20 times harder than joining Harvard
- [x] Politics kills promotions
- [x] Competition is inevitable
  - with great responsibility can come extreme stress
  - if stress and competition is inevitable why not start your own company
- [x] Company hopping

  - especially for higher salaries
    Working at Google and here's my personal experience about these reasons:

    1.1. I worked at a office outside of CA, they have only breakfast and lunch, and people just comes in as late as possible right before the breakfast ends, it is hilarious and actually reasonable because no one else is working at that time anyway. The food is not that good though.
    1.2. We technically could bring dogs and some does it. They don't want cats to come however, so it really isn't about tricking employees to stay longer.

    2.  Work pressure differs between teams, some got lucky and has near zero pressure and some needs to wake up at midnight if the website is down for 3 minutes. If you got a good team or manager it is really great.

    3.  As long as you are hired, it does not take anyone a lot of effort to "just survive" because you already proved, or at least convinced them you are one of the best engineer out there(which actually surprises many engineers how bad other people can be). However you are indeed going to work with or hear stories about some insanely good people who does the work of hundreds of people. IMO it is just something average people needs to suck it up and move on about the fact that some people are really just that good instead of tryharding.

    4.  I remember average promotion takes 3 years, so yeah if people left with a year or two it's going to be hard.

    5.  The "worked at google" line on your resume beats ten projects so people gets a lot more chance going to startups and such, so if they get +30k a year then quitting does not seem bad at all. Opening your own startup is not really related to the quit data though, si
