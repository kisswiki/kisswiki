## History

> PageRank meant the system was less easily gamed and produced higher quality results. The real magic was combining that with their revolutionary data center operations and being able to treat a whole lab of machines as a single device which ran via map/reduce.
The clean design helped as well but it was incremental. Google's advantage was that they produced better results faster with lower operating costs. Better and faster were good for customers. Then the rollout of relevant ads meant that Google could turn a profit even at lower cpm than competitors and their ads didn't have to be intrusive or distracting. The combination put them on much surer footing than their competitors so they kept growing, increasing revenue and profit while their competitors struggled.

## How to change from google.xx to google.com?

I usually get redirected to http://www.google.co.nz

However, typing "/ncr" after the address takes me to that site with no redirection

## ad publishing

I am currently struggling with Google and been even considering just straight up creating a Brazilian "Yandex/Baidu" clone or something somehow.

My current business is heavily Google reliant, and Google been proving to be a very poor business partner:

* Keeps punishing my site both in organic rank and AdWords rank (thus price) for not being mobile, despite my site being intended to be viewed by engineers with big screens.

* They remove frequently whatever features they had to avoid wasting money, the one that offended me the most is that I can't anymore advertise on mobile websites unless I also allow apps too, and apps are purely fraudulent clicks, babies don't buy industrial parts...

* Google refuses to take care of fraud, I've visited the top sources of clicks on my display campaigns and there was comments for example on store pages explicitly complaining it was pure fraud, and Google does nothing about it (example: one source of clicks was a flashlight app on Android that opens ads whenever the user turns the flashlight on, clicking the ad is only way to turn it off again)

* Google often randomly stop my ads and search because bogus reasons, requiring me to call them to fix it.

* They removed from AdWords interface the max click price when the campaign is in automatic mode, in the past this was very useful to find out if their AI was bugged (like one time it insisted on setting max cpm to 0.01 despite average cost until that day being 1.20...) or oberpricing me (charging ludicrous prices per click)

Their product (ad publishing, not search) is crap, but they have literal Monopoly, all other ads publishers I tried gave me almost zero clicks...
