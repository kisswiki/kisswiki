Katanas arenâ€™t sharper than any other well made sword whether it be european or asian or from some other place. Yes, it's form helps with cutting but in return it has some other drawbacks, for example having no real thrusting point and having only one sharp edge. Also the only reason the japanese had to fold their steel is because of the poor quality of it. The japanese tatara couldn't get the iron as hot as european furnaces and thus left the steel quite impure. Folding the steel was a necessary evil to clean out the impurities while also losing much of the important carbon.

They had to pick out the very high carbon bits of the mainly unusable furnace product to end up with some steel that was mostly pure but still had enough carbon content. So a well made Katana with properly purified steel was no better in quality than a well made european sword which's steel was pure to begin with. Yes Katanas are cool, but they're far from being that superior weapon pop culture makes you believe it is.
Good for the dude tho, seems like he's happy now.
