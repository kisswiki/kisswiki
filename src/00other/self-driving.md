Self-driving:

For me this is a big drawback of half-baked autopilot. It takes us humans time to engage in a split second and react to surroundings even if they are monitoring it. When driving I'm constantly updating my situation awareness by doing a 360 degree scan every few seconds and I'm 100% engaged with the car so I know which way to safely swerve, what happens if I slam the brakes etc.,. With this auto-pilot-assist I'm monitoring mostly forward and I'm not engaged with the car so my ability to handle emergency situation is severely impaired.

Right; you're practicing inductive logic--something computers can't do--at all times, thus essentially predicting possible futures. Until this ability is present in software, there won't be an adequate replacement.

Yup. Rodney Brooks, famed robot scientist and iRobot founder, says not to expect driverless taxis in cities earlier than 2035: https://rodneybrooks.com/my-dated-predictions/
I don't think we quite need AGI to make something like a commercial urban taxi service work. For any given place, we can substitute a very large amount of training data. And I think we can get there through an approach like Waymo, where the taxi's number one job is to ask for central human help if it's in the slightest confused or at risk of causing harm. But even that will be a very long slog.

And for the supposed goal of "full self-driving", I agree that is basically AGI, because it requires levels of judgment that even humans struggle with. The other day I came across some Covid-related road changes and I had to reason about human intent as expressed in roads while exchanging human social signals with the people around me.

Brooks suggests we instead may see people trying to simplify the problem by banning humans and/or human drivers from areas where we want automated driving. That's anthema to me, but given the history of building to favor cars vs other mo
