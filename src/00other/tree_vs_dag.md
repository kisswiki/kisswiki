Here's the problem with family trees: they are not trees. They are directed acyclic graphs or DAGs. If I understand the principles of the biology of human reproduction correctly, there will not be any cycles.

As far as I know, even the Christians accept marriages (and thus children) between cousins, which will turn the family tree into a family DAG.
