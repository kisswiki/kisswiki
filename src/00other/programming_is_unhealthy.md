TL;DR: the saddest part of being a programmer is that you have the most unnatural profession known to humankind, and it’s not healthy for your mind and body. Unlike other professions, which involve at least some sort of social and physical interactions, programming will not be helping with your well-being in any way. And while it may not sound as a big issue, it is.

Long answer: I see a lot of answers about lack of appreciation and visible result, however I would say it’s not the saddest part, at least from my point of view. Sure it could be stressful sometimes and may lack for positive feedback, but some other jobs too.

I believe there’s a bigger and more distinctive problem that you have to face while being a programmer. And to describe this problem I’d like to quote Jonathan Blow, a video game programmer:

”Computers are fundamentally depressing because our bodies in its natural state does not expect to be motionless and focusing on an artificial things for a long time”.

There are techniques to deal with that (and the topic Johnathan was discussing is those techniques, really recommend looking into that), but it’s impossible to avoid that your body will fight you for your choice of profession. And while there are a lot of jobs that are stressful or heavy on your physical health, programming is really psychologically damaging in a very fundamental way, and there’s nothing you can do about it.

While you can enjoy programming on a short term, you have to acknowledge that for your body it’s the sadness in its pure form. You’re not interacting with people often. You’re not getting dopamine from physical activity. You’re sitting for hours, staring at the (thanks god not that flashing these days) screen and focusing, focusing, focusing on a task that is truly unnatural for your brain. It’s completely abstract tasks usually, not something your brain evolutionary supposed to do. It’s like math with anxiety of engineering.

Millions years of evolution are looking at you and trying to drag you down with a reasonable question of “what the hell are you doing”, because there’s no way a primate brain evolved to reward you for writing a letters on screen which supposed to control electricity flow to automate something. And I really believe that the sooner one will understand that, the better. You can be in love with programming, it’s a field with unlimited possibilities and great opportunities, but always take care of your mind and your body for heaven’s sake. In other professions there might be social endorsement or positive impact from physical activities, but not with programming — your passion with this job won’t last long if you won’t be serious about your mental state and this can be really devastating. Burnouts and depression are very common for this profession, and there’s solid biological reason for that.

## As I hit 40, I also hit a career ceiling.

I enjoy what I do and it has gotten me far but no-one really cares about good code as long as it does the job.

I cannot grow in my current role unless I take on more leadership; something I am not interested in doing. So my peers, who would rather have meetings than write code, are now directors and VPs leaving me in the dust in terms of both compensation and influence.

I feel good on most days. My calendar is mostly clear of meetings and I can focus hours on end on what I enjoy and do best. However, once in a while, I get a ping from someone I knew a long time back and when I see their title, I feel a twinge.

We are nothing but machines that churn out code in an industry ultimately governed by those who are good with people rather than with computers. That realization is the saddest thing about being a programmer for me.

## This job like any other, will affect you and your personality.

But rather than becoming a smooth talker like a salles person, strong and tough like a construction worker, fit like a sports coach; you'll grow to become a computer.

Without the right mindset and effort to fight back, you'll find yourself running algorithms on people, looking in the computer in your friends and oosing your social skills.

And in the midst of all of that, you ll struggle to find time to fix that.

##

- You become lazy. As you keep sitting with the laptop the whole day, there is hardly any physical movement of the body. Hence, it affects physical health.
- Again due to hours of sitting in front of the laptop screen, the eyes get strained.
- Your interaction with other people reduces considerably and this affects your communication skills as well as mental health.
- In a corporate setting, it's not often you get praised for writing a good piece of code.
- It challenges our patience whenever we are unable to debug an error or a warning. Sometimes, it takes a million years to remove a small bug.
- Unless we write comments, we will most probably forget what the piece of code does after a few months.
- Being a programmer, your best friend is not a human being. Your best friends are Stack Overflow and Google.

## Some of my regrets

- You’ll always feel like an imposter
- There’s always something you don’t know how to do inside a deadline
- Perfect code is just beyond reach
- That new stuff? It hasn’t improved that old stuff much
- People. The best and the worst parts of this job - Estimation. Don’t be silly.
- None of this gets better
- You will never get ‘on top’ where you can just do everything

And I’m still not rich.
