## RateLimitError: Error code: 429 - {'error': {'message': 'You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details. For more information on this error, read the docs: <https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/error-codes/api-errors>.', 'type': 'insufficient_quota', 'param': None, 'code': 'insufficient_quota'}}

I had 18$ but it expired. Here https://platform.openai.com/usage it showed 0$/18$.

I have added billing information for invoice <https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview>

## Example

<https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt4-1_prompting_guide#example-prompt-customer-service>

I have used uv to install openai: `uv add ipykernel openai`.

I have run `uv venv`. Also in `windsurf > cmd+shift+p > Jupyter: Select Interpreter to Start Jupyter Server` and selected one in `.venv`.

Or maybe it was `Notebook: Select Notebook Kernel`.

I have hardcoded api key:

```python
client = OpenAI(
    api_key=
        "<api_key>"
)
```

After running first example in Jupyter I got:

```

After replacing `content.text` with regex enabled: `\\n` to `\n`:

Let's begin by carefully analyzing the sparse information in your bug report:

**You wrote:**  
> Bug: Typerror...

## Step 1: Gather Context

This is very minimal information. I need to:

- Check if any more details are contained in the `run_tests.py` or a test file’s output, as those will likely output the exact stack trace with the TypeError.
- Look for the likely cause: TypeErrors generally occur when a function is called with the wrong number/type of arguments, or if operations are performed on incompatible types.

## Step 2: Plan

Let's proceed as follows:

1. **Run the tests** to generate the TypeError and get the traceback. This will likely identify exactly what file, function, and line the exception arises from.
2. Once I see the error message and the code causing it, I will:
    - Investigate that part of the code for type-related mistakes: argument mismatch, misuse of types, etc.
    - Check up and downstream code for consistency.
3. After identifying the root cause, I will develop a targeted code fix.
4. Rerun the tests to confirm the issue is solved.
5. Check for similar bugs or other areas that need fixing.

## Step 3: Initial Action

Let’s run the tests to surface the TypeError details.

---

**Action:**  
Run the test suite to get the full error message.
