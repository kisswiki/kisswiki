## download paid materials

yt-dlp does not work currently for paid materials https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues/30740

Download button does not work currently for course https://twitter.com/rofrol/status/1504839045372915714

You can download single lesson by clicking download icon.

But you cannot download free lesson from course that way.

For that I need to use yt-dlp.

## download free materials

```
brew install youtube-dl
brew install ffmpeg
```

Download video:
