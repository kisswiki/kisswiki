## Why Red Hat does not have engineers to support btrfs?

You have to understand how most kernel teams work across all companies. Kernel engineers work on what they want to work on, and companies hire the people working on the thing the company cares about to make sure they get their changes in.

This means that the engineers have 95% of the power. Sure you can tell your kernel developer to go work on something else, but if they don't want to do that they'll just go to a different company that will let them work on what they care about.

This gives Red Hat 2 options. One is they hire existing Btrfs developers to come help do the work. That's unlikely to happen unless they get one of the new contributors, as all of the seasoned developers are not likely to move. The second is to develop the talent in-house. But again we're back at that "it's hard to tell kernel engineers what to do" problem. If nobody wants to work on it then there's not going to be anybody that will do it.
