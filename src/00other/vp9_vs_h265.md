The most comprehensive test I've seen [1] led Netflix to conclude that H.265 was better than VP9 by about 20%, including resolutions all the way down to 360p. In my own experience and other tests I've seen the gap seems even wider. There's a few usecases where VP9 is superior (most notably screencasts), but generally it seems to lag behind H.265 while also being much slower to encode.
