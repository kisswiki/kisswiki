## Refresh project file list

I have added README.md but couldn't find it in Structure tab. I needed to switch to "Project files" instead of "Android".

Theres is also `File > Reload All from Disk`.

## .gitignore

It was already created with new project. Thought there are these resources:

- https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Android.gitignore
