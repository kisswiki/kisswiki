## Sending javascript to the client's browser is a distribution

> You have distributed the JavaScript library to the user; you are required to comply with the GPL's requirements on distribution then

> in the case of Dart the resulting object code is JavaScript which is distributed to the client in the vast majority of cases. Obviously, if you're doing something really weird like running JavaScript server-side, then it doesn't count as distribution.

> What about this apparent exception for JavaScript listed in the GPL FAQ? https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#WMS
> That exception is only valid if the author adds it to the license. Anyway, it still contaminates your other javascript code

> By minifying code and removing comments; one might argue that the GPL is not being followed to the letter of the law. By providing a comment in the minified JS pointing to the js source file this should solve most potential issues as a link to the unmodified source is now provided.
