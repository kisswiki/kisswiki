- `npm install -g typescript`

>The main reason why I prefer TypeScript at the current point in time is that it encourages the use of type-safety more so than Flow. It has been my experience that when you work with a team on a project, Flow does nothing to enforce the usage of static-typing, meaning that your team members can very easily sidestep Flowâ€™s type-checking. With TypeScript, it is a given that anyone working on the project will be using static typing and you end up with higher quality code as a result.
