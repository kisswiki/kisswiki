RMS founded GNU 1984 and FSF in 1985.
He was the only spiritual leader - no one else showed up to get any trust in all these years.
All the blame and insults was aimed at him - like communism, cancer, ... GPL being something bad and that kind of stuff.
No talk or interview without citing him in a wrong way ... so many times ... with his talks and interviews always being brilliant and to the point.
It is a real problem of no respect for such a man who did it not for money like Gates, Jobs and the rest ... and who stood up when no one else did.
We will see if the FSF can survive that.

GNU is important, but is more about code.
I can not remember anyone giving a good talk about free software and pointing to the real critical things to take care of.
No one - except him.
So there is no one who can lead the FSF - as simple as that. No person is coming to my mind.
Comparing to Linux Torvalds he was never the only one - Alan Cox, Andrew Morton, Greg Kroah-Hartman.
All made their points and got trust by their saying and doing.
And from my point of view GNOME may be more comparable to Microsoft as given in the ironic statement - they never understood what freedom of users mean.
Not even technically when forcing special workflows and restricting people from configuring SW similar to Microsoft.

It will be quite interesting who will step up and the way showing the spirit behind the new FSF.
The FSF is not the LF - where the CEO can make a talk with a non-Linux device or using proprietary SW. 
It would be a pity if the FSF and its goals will vanish to another open source thing without meaning ...

But the positive thing is: RMS seems to be capable and willing of staying there and reminding people of what should be done.
I personally hope that he will stay committed and has the energy to stand to free software and keep the excellent work he did for all these important goals.
How important these goals are today is much clearer now than those days when GNU and the FSF were founded ...
