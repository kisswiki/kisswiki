## Ligatures

the problems are:

- For example ≠ is very different from !=, and since some languages allow unicode symbols it could be confusing
- Languages are very different. In Haskell [i*i | i<-[1..]] should be rendered as [i*i | i⟵[1..]], but if - x<-3 should not become if x ⟵3. Lua has ~= instead of != and so on.
- The font has no context awareness. Ligatures would be shown in comments, documentation, strings...
