D3 is still a useful library for visualization even if you replace the DOM manipulation with React, Vue, Svelte, etc. I think the trend is to use D3 as a library but use a more modern framework to manage the DOM.

I have a browser extension (treeverse.app) where the entire UI is D3. I probably wouldn't write it that way today, but the codebase dates back to ~2014 and it's held up fine.
