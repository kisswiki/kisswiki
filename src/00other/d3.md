D3 is still a useful library for visualization even if you replace the DOM manipulation with React, Vue, Svelte, etc. I think the trend is to use D3 as a library but use a more modern framework to manage the DOM.

I have a browser extension (treeverse.app) where the entire UI is D3. I probably wouldn't write it that way today, but the codebase dates back to ~2014 and it's held up fine. 



I used to use D3.js as the default go-to for data. Now I start with Vue.js, and use D3.js only inside some components when I need, animations between transitions.

D3.js, as someone else already noted, is "jQuery for data". And yes, it has its good parts, but the same as for jQuery) the problem is with:

- mixing static HTML/SVG with generated

- no modularization (every modularization is custom)

For the latter, while it may not be a big deal for small projects, for bigger it sucks.

For big stories, I created a game in D3.js. Modularization was... well, argument why I rewrote it a few years later to Vue.js.
