## filter messages by attachment size

From Edit/Find/Search Messages (Ctrl+Shift+F), select Size as the filter rule and enter 'is greater than' and a number like 6826 KB (see picture). Keep in mind that encoding overhead adds about 33% of the size of an attachment to the total size of a message, so a message with a 6MB attachment has a total size of 8MB. 'Save as Search Folder' if you perform this function frequently.

## how can I empty a mail folder quickly?

To select all emails in a folder:

- click on folder to see emails
- press 'Ctrl' + 'A' keys and all emails should get highlighted.

A list of 'conversations will appear in the lower Message Pane

- click on 'Delete'

To completely remove all hidden marked as deleted emails and release space in the folder:

Please note this will delete messages in Thunderbird and originals on remote server.

- Right click on folder and select 'Properties'
- select 'Retention Policy' tab
- uncheck 'Use my account settings'
- choose from the options listed
- eg: select : 'Delete messages more than xx days old.'
