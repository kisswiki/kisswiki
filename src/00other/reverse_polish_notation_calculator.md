## Order of operations

1. exponentiation and root extraction
2. multiplication and division
3. addition and subtraction

### PEMDAS or BEDMAS

Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction

### Paradox

> Google, [Wolfram](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i2d=true&i=6%C3%B72%5C%2840%291%2B2%5C%2841%29), and many pocket calculators give the answer of 9:

`6รท2(1+2)=9`

Wolfram Alpha and it [yields](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i2d=true&i=y%3Dsin3x) the sinusoid `y=sin(3x)`, rather than the line through the origin with slope `sin3`.

Jenni Gorham, a maths tutor with a degree in Physics, points out numerous occasions in which scientists write `a/bc` to mean `a/(bc)`.
