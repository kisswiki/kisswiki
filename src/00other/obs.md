## When started recording: Invalid Path or Connection URL

> If you want to record, you should press Start Recording, not Start Streaming. You haven't configured a streaming server which is why you get the error when you press Start Streaming. https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/invalid-path-or-connection-url-error-keeps-appearing.69962/post-299324

## Blank screen on Windows 10

I needed to change `Settings > Graphics Settings > Add Obs > Options > Power saving (Intel)`. With `Performance (nVidia)` there was blank screen.

## Mouse clicks

Use [Mouse pointer highlight](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/mouse-pointer-highlight/9p7sb9s4rq7z) from Microsoft Store

Works with Display capture. Does not work with Window Capture.

There is also paid http://www.pointerfocus.com/.

## Crop area

`Right click the source > Filters > Add Crop/Pad`

After that `Right click the source > Resize output (source size)` which will set your canvas and output sizes to match the source size.
