Choosing Android 10 as base

I didn't have to add `kotlinOptions { jvmTarget = '1.8' }` to `app/build.gradle` as it was already set.

To open `AndroidManifest.xml` (`app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`) I needed to click xml icon on the side of `MainActivity.kt`.

`MainActivity` has layout with file name backward `activity_main.xml`.
