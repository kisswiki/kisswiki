### "Compose preview" in Adnroid studio to preview without running

Android Studio and Split, `@Preview`, default value or `@PreviewParameter`, `backgroundColor`, `showBackgroroundColor`, `widthDp`, `heightDp`. `locale = "de-rDE"` and `values-de-rDE/strings.xml`, Translations Editor, `showSystemUi`, `device` and `Devices.PIXEL_C`, `group`, `preview > right-click > Copy Image`, `preview > deploy` to real device or emulator and creates new launch configuration

Choosing Android 10 as base

I didn't have to add `kotlinOptions { jvmTarget = '1.8' }` to `app/build.gradle` as it was already set.

There is also kotlin-dsl https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41113268/how-to-set-up-kotlins-byte-code-version-in-gradle-project-to-java-8/45994990#45994990

To open `AndroidManifest.xml` (`app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`) I needed to click xml icon on the side of `MainActivity.kt`.

`MainActivity` has layout with file name backward `activity_main.xml`.

These drawables are svg files:

- `app/src/main/res/drawable-v24/ic_launcher_foreground.xml`
- `app/src/main/res/drawable/ic_launcher_background.xml`

Open 'Build' View

> all buildscript {} blocks must appear before any plugins {} blocks in the script

I have read also prerequisites:

- https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/setup

When there is preview for composable, in split or design view at the top, there is refresh icon: "Build Refresh" alt+cmd+shift+r

After using `Column`, I needed to import it with `alt+enter` with cursor over `Column`.

I needed to import `Image` by hand `import androidx.compose.foundation.Image`.

`Image` does not use curly braces. Use `Image()`. Also first import is `import android.media.Image` which is wrong.

Android Studio hanged on "Import Drawables" when I clicked "Downloads" in Finder. In Activity Monitor, Android Studio has adnotation "Not responding".

Drag-and-drop from Finder worked. Also MacOS asked if I want to give Android Studio permission to view Downloads folder.

Image showed in Resource Manager after I run "Build Refresh".

When using Image like in tutorial

```kotlin
        Image(
            painter = painterResource(R.drawable.profile_picture),
            contetDescription = "Contact profile picture",
        )
```

I got error: "None of the following functions can be called with the arguments supplied."

This worked:

```kotlin
        Image(
            painterResource(R.drawable.profile_picture),
            "Contact profile picture",
        )
```
