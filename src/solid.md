> I have seen too much code made hard-to-read and way-too-big-for-what-it-does by people trying to apply SOLID principles without really understanding why. That helper class with its 4 methods probably didn't need to be split out into 4 separate classes - you're basically a terrorist if you're doing that kind of shit to your team's codebase in the name of SOLID. Treating the SOLID principles like dogmatic rules to be enforced at every opportunity just leads to rotten places like the Kingdom of Nouns and FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition.
