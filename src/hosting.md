> Will always be free for users

> Closest servers are found using speedtest.net API

> I would recommend getting rid of the speedtest.net test to instead use more data center speed test files.
> The speedtest.net tests work horribly on servers. Geolocation is most always wrong, the server you are testing from often has more bandwidth available than the speed test server (which leads to incorrect reports) and it is very inconsistent.

> Well the speedtest website does both upload and download tests when a user runs it. Most every time a customer comes to me saying they are not getting their advertised network speed it is because they are using the speedtest.net cli tool. It is wrong too much and just leads to clients getting incorrect results.
> I always end up telling them that the test is not suitable to test servers.

> Speedtest sux - use iperf instead
