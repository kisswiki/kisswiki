> Will always be free for users

> Closest servers are found using speedtest.net API

> I would recommend getting rid of the speedtest.net test to instead use more data center speed test files.
> The speedtest.net tests work horribly on servers. Geolocation is most always wrong, the server you are testing from often has more bandwidth available than the speed test server (which leads to incorrect reports) and it is very inconsistent.

> Well the speedtest website does both upload and download tests when a user runs it. Most every time a customer comes to me saying they are not getting their advertised network speed it is because they are using the speedtest.net cli tool. It is wrong too much and just leads to clients getting incorrect results.
> I always end up telling them that the test is not suitable to test servers.

> Speedtest sux - use iperf instead

> Iperf needs another server. And I think nobody wants to expose one to the volumes of traffic it needs

> Most speedtest.net servers seem to have 1Gbps max connection to them. Speedtest.net is designed to test residential connections so most of the time this is fine.
> My nodes each have a 10Gbps connection, 10x that of the server they are testing against. If you combine that with the bandwidth being used by others testing against the speed test server the results are usually far far off, even when in close proximity.
