I'd take a slightly different take:

- Structure your code so it is mostly leaves.
- Unit test the leaves.
- Integration test the rest if needed.

I like this approach in part because making lots of leaves also adds to the "literate"-ness of the code. With lots of opportunities to name your primitives, the code is much closer to being self documenting.
Depending on the project and its requirements, I also think "lazy" testing has value. Any time you are looking at a block of code, suspicious that it's the source of a bug, write a test for it. If you're in an environment where bugs aren't costly, where attribution goes through few layers of code, and bugs are easily visible when they occur, this can save a lot of time.

My leaves are either pure functions (FP languages) or value objects that init themselves based on other value objects (OOP languages). These value objects have no methods, no computed properties, etc. Just inert data.
No mocks and no “header” interfaces needed.
On top of that I sprinkle a bunch of UI tests to verify it’s all properly wired up.
