## Opera VPN

> Opera "VPN" is just a preconfigured HTTP/S proxy protecting just the traffic between Opera and the proxy, nothing else. It's not a VPN
> When you use the proxy on a different machine (with no Opera installed), you'll get the same IP as when using Opera's VPN, of course.

> Opera's VPN seems to stand up well when tested for DNS leaks, but unfortunately it's still vulnerable to the well-known WebRTC VPN security flaw which betrays your true location.
> Visit https://ipleak.net/ with Opera's VPN enabled and it will list a foreign IP address instead of your own, but scroll down to WebRTC detection and you'll see your true IP address staring back at you. Other WebRTC test sites confirm the flaw.
