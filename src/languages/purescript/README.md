I'd go a little further and say that while PureScript is closer to JavaScript than Haskell in some dimensions, there are others in which it's even further away. I just don't see a viable path to learning PureScript at all that doesn't start with "first, learn Haskell." There are not enough resources to walk people through the baby steps in PureScript itself; and as far as I can tell, the community is not at all interested in compromising their abstraction towers with any kind of simplified ideas at all!

PureScript's performance is not even close to Elm right now and I don't know of any other alternatives to Elm. Besides, purescript-halogen, the most popular PureScript framework, looks very complicated compared to elm-lang/http.
