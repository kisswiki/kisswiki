I'd go a little further and say that while PureScript is closer to JavaScript than Haskell in some dimensions, there are others in which it's even further away. I just don't see a viable path to learning PureScript at all that doesn't start with "first, learn Haskell." There are not enough resources to walk people through the baby steps in PureScript itself; and as far as I can tell, the community is not at all interested in compromising their abstraction towers with any kind of simplified ideas at all!
