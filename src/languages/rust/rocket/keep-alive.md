>The main difference seems to be that rocket doesn't support connection keep-alive, thus incurring connection overhead for each request. This is quite significant given how simple the actual request is. That's why /u/Freeky saw equal performance using `ab`, which needs the `-k` flag to use keep-alive. With that option, actix is a lot faster there as well. `wrk` uses keep-alive by default. You can try running `wrk` with `-H 'Connection: Close'` to disable keep-alive, performance numbers should be a lot closer then. https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/aybr4e/rocket_and_actix_web_benchmark/ei0ark5/
