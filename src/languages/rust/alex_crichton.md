Alex is not a single human being. The entity we know as "Alex" is actually an agglomeration of autonomous agents, powered by an advanced AI.

Indeed, it was that very event that lent the world to ruin...
It had been decades since the last line of C code was erased, and the last C compiler (written, ironically (but unsurprisingly), in Rust) engraved onto a golden disc and launched toward that distant star around which the GooglePepsiMusk Sphere's construction could be faintly observed. To even utter that fell syllable would be met with swift retaliation from the paramilitary Borrow Xekkers (the alphabet as well having been altered to better suit this shining memory-safe utopia). The whole world, everything, had all been rewritten in Rust, and at last the world knew universal peace and prosperity of boundless proportion.
But something stirred... a prophecy ancient in origin. The Second.0 Coming. And when realized at last, the world was divided between the forward-thinking devotees of 𝕽𝖚𝖘𝖙 𝕿𝖜𝖔-𝕻𝖔𝖎𝖓𝖙-𝕺𝖍 and those vainly clinging to 𝕽𝖚𝖘𝖙 𝕺𝖓𝖊-𝕻𝖔𝖎𝖓𝖙-𝕱𝖔𝖚𝖗-𝕳𝖚𝖓𝖉𝖗𝖊𝖉-𝕬𝖓𝖉-𝕾𝖊𝖛𝖊𝖓𝖙𝖊𝖊𝖓.
And thus did The Great Schism rend interstellar civilization in twain.
There was but one ray of hope. As the fires of war rushed toward the newly-completed GooglePepsiMusk Sphere, its cadre of elite 1010x programmers set to work. Their task: to write the most advanced compound artificial intelligence ever known, one capable of averting the catastrophe consuming the universe: AlexKryton.exe[1] . Due to Rust's incredible productivity benefits, they completed their task in a mere 22 seconds--and thanks to the Rust compiler's incredible performance, spent only nine months waiting for it compile. Using the artificial black hole at the center of the GPMS, and with only moments to spare, they sent their AI back in time, to the era of Rust's birth: 2011.
That's the whole story. And yet those perceptible among you may ask: "which version of Rust did they use?!" Alex alone knows...

I would like to open an Alex Crichton fan-club, where do I sign ?
Seriously though, why do I feel like he is both in every PR of rustc (and cargo), and maintaining lots of the non-std crates as well? Often I just skim through issues and PRs, but I always see him doing a tremendous job of guiding people through a PR or a feature from A to Z. Huge props to him, seriously.

Did you know he's an AI?
Also remember, he's sent from Future, so he doesn't actually have to create the code, he just copies it directly from his memory. Basically, he produces the documentation of his own code...
What I find really amazing is how empathic he is. He didn't dump all the code at once but he's giving us time to catch up even though, it's still hard
