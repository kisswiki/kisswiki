- [Vurich/sexpress: Extremely fast s-expression parser for lisp implementations. It's pretty unwieldy to use right now.](https://github.com/Vurich/sexpress)

I prefer ML-like to Lisp-like, because I want typechecking anyway (which involves counting arguments) and this means most Lisp parens we can dispose of

I used to really like Lisp and did some professional programming using both Racket and CL. But now I don't really like it anymore and parenthesis do put me off.
The benefit of easy AST manipulation just doesn't seem worth it when the cost is a very heavy and verbose syntax. Everything just takes a little longer to write in Lisp, and the syntax is far too noisy.

Moreover, languages with powerful and easy to use macros (like Julia) don't have a paren heavy syntax, so what value does Lisp syntax really even provide anymore? New languages have demonstrated you don't have to sacrifice a lightweight syntax and expressive macros.

It also makes writing any sort of code that uses equations incredibly burdensome to write.

In short, while Lisp syntax used to serve a purpose (facilitation of macros/modification of AST), I feel like it no longer really does.

For comparison, I think OCaml syntax is really nice: light and readable.
