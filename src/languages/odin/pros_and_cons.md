I would argue that Zig’s inability to produce static or dynamic libraries that use Zig features in its API is a much bigger problem that Odin’s lack of a package manager.

Neither Odin nor C3 has any problems with this, and it simply follows from Zig’s semantics that it is rendered impossible.

So will Zig semantics change (which would be a big change indeed), or will Zig precompiles libraries always be forced to go by way of special C-compatible calls and types?

Before I’d declare Zig the winner due to a package manager I’d be sure to figure that one out.
