#### Token movement

in Vim `WEB` does something different than `sll` in ki

Also why it is Vim `W` Vim `E` Vim `B` and not Vim `WEB`?

Maybe to show how to move in Vim, but maybe there should be only strict equivalent?

#### Word movement

No Vim equivalent

#### Undo & Redo

Why Vim `u` Vim `ctrl+r` and not Vim `u` `ctrl+r`?

#### Repeat last non-contigous selection mode

No Vim equivalent
