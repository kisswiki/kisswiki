## Type of keyboard switches

Cherry MX Speed Silver (on Ergodox): These are the switches I ended up settling on. Buttery smooth, low pressure. With the higher actuation point, I was able to add O-ring dampers to reduce the travel (and keep me from bottoming out). With this combo, I got the travel of the Havit, but with a much much lighter key (I also really like the ortho-linear layout). It is nowhere near as satisfying to type on vs the blue switches. But I'll trade that for a pain free evening.
