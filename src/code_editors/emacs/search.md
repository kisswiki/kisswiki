## Search word

I think you are searching for the Word Search feature, activated with `M-s w`.

You can use it in two ways: simply issue `M-s w`, then type the word to search. Or to get something similar to `*` in vim, you can start a search with isearch, with `C-s C-w` (this searches for the word under cursor), then `M-s` w to toggle the search to whole word mode.
