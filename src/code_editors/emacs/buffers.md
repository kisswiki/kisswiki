I've recently started using C-x <left> and C-x <right>. Those are both standard Emacs bindings—nothing to configure. Left takes you back to the previous buffer (initially the same as C-x b RET) but doing it again takes you to the 3rd most recently visited buffer. If you're popping back and forth between 3 or 4 buffers a lot then I find it a lot easier than trying to remember buffer names.

Also I just discovered C-x C-<left> and C-x C-<right> are bound to the same functions so that you can just hold down the control key and alternate between x and the arrows to flip through buffers.
