I wanted to use org-mode inspired by [Emacs' org-mode gets citation support | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28048880).

Googling "org-mode book pdf" gave this:

- https://orgmode.org/orgguide.pdf
- https://orgmode.org/org.pdf

I have also found this https://www.udemy.com/course/getting-yourself-organized-with-org-mode/

When googling "emacs org-mode first file" I came to https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org4beginners.html

First problem was that I could not set keb bindings like in tutorial. Emacs was reading different config. Refer to emacs-config-file-location.md.
