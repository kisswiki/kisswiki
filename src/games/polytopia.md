## reviews

i knew this game from years ago on mobile and only recently did i buy it on steam, it is an ok time killer and it's easy to understand, but it suffers of a couple problems that i wish were addressed earlier, seeing as every update takes so long to happen

firstly, some tribes are inherently worse than the others, be it because of resource rates, starting technology, or both, so even when i want to enjoy something new, i'll have to face the fact i'm more likely to lose a game simply because theres a clear better option that my opponent is likely to choose
at the moment im writing this, theres two tribes that can have an instant win against you if youre unlucky enough to spawn close to them, one of which permanently freezes your starting units, and the other which can spam their tribe specific units with high damage to overwhelm you before you have a chance to retaliate

secondly, even if i were to play a mirror 1v1 match, theres still the issue with rng, this is more noticeable in quick games done in smaller maps (which i assume to be how most games go), where someone will have a noticeable advantage from their spawn alone, so even if youre skilled, you still cant control getting barely any resources, or as i mentioned earlier, getting freezelocked because your opponent is the first in the turn queue

so to sum it up, its an alright game, but the updates not addressing these things has been a real turn off, it's not fun nor engaging to know that you lost not because of skill, but because the game is just designed that way

Def not worth $6(full price).
I LOVE the game, Phone Player at first, bought for PC now
Singleplayer is so much fun but that just it, Multiplayer is unplayable imo, it takes hours to finish 1 game because of the wait turn and most people rage quit if they feel it's losing(it def takes some of the fun from the match).
I love repetitive games and I play them all the time, but 85% of the time it is just me waiting for their turn to finish.
the queue time is also VERY LONG.

- IT also doesn't help that they put 2 of the best tribes behind a paywall

So I mostly just play Singleplayer, but I wish they would make the bot a little bit more intricate maybe each tribes have more tendencies and act more smartly. maybe making logical alliances with intentions, that way it incentivize the player to also make alliances to actually win the game, ( I also wish that you could finish the game with your alliance).

Tl:dr= game not worth buying full price, and you have to get the 2 additional tribes, and only singleplayer is playable and you can easily get bored of it.

like the game. However, the devs ruined it by allowing players to "buy" wins with the purchase of the 4 expansion tribes that dominate the rest. Elyrion is totally dominant in a 4 or 9 player game if they aren't taken out in the early rounds. This makes the game much less fun.
