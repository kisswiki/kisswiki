## ios10 disconnects game controllers and other bluetooth devices

- probably no problems with SteelSeries Nimbus. Workaround: take off batteries (or usb cable) in controller, turn off bluetooth in ios, turn on bluetooth, put batteries back.

  - The titles I've enjoyed the most are:
    - Horizon Chase: Full game after buying the IAP, awesome controls, full control support, superb music
    - Wayward Souls: One of my fav titles of all time, also full control support, a ridiculous amount of content and good music!
    - Crypt of the Necrodancer : The whole PC experience, awesome music, awesome game mechanics, PURE AWESOMENESS!!!
    - Lost Socks Naughty Brothers: My favorite run 'n' gun on ios, one of the most stylish games on iOS, full control support, and pure Hardcore fun.
    - Downwell: A brutal experience too, and one of the best of 2015!
    - Goblin Sword: A nice Platformer with lots of content and cool pixel art.
    - Emulators!! I have Happy Chick that supports MFI
    - Traps and Gemstones: Metroidvania fun!!
    - LIMBO: Do I have to add something?
    - Leo's Fortune
    - Space Marshals
    - Bastion
    - Xenowerk, by the same dev as Space Marshals, is one of my favorite. It's a twin-stick shooter that I had fun with on the iPad. The neatest thing about it was that when I played with the SteelSeries Nimbus, the button prompts on screen changed to reflect the controller. I thought it was a nice touch!
