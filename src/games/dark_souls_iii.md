## GOTY vs Deluxe vs Fire fades

fire fades is the Japanese version. For the rest of Asia and also Europe it is called Game of the Year

Deluxe Edition on Steam is just a bundle of the Game and DLCs.

The only possible difference between Deluxe and GOTY could potentially be the price tag... but we'll have to see.
