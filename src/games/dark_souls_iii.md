The Fires Fade Edition of Dark Souls III is a game bundle that includes the original game and all released DLC.

All bundle editions include the base game, Ashes of Ariandel and The Ringed City DLCs. The Japanese version coincides with the launch of an 80-page Japanese guide and map. You can get this for free over at the Japanese Wiki.

fire fades is the Japanese version. For the rest of Asia and also Europe it is called Game of the Year

Deluxe Edition on Steam is just a bundle of the Game and DLCs.

The only possible difference between Deluxe and GOTY could potentially be the price tag... but we'll have to see.

The "Fire Fades edition" is the fully updated game with the DLC, basically the deluxe edition. The only difference is that if you bought the Deluxe edition back in the day you had to go through all the updates and dowloads, if you buy "The fire fades edition" when it releases it will be just one big file.
