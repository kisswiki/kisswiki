## Keyboard

Use AWSD in menu.

ZC to toggle cattegories in Settings.

## Steam Controller

Could not make it work.

First tried https://github.com/Alia5/GloSC but game needs to be added to Steam, and I game from xbox are in `C:\Program Files\WindowsApps`. This is folder is restricted and I didn't want to mess with it.

Then I tried https://github.com/kozec/sc-controller/wiki/Running-SC-Controller-on-Windows

It was working with Steam Controller but only in main menu.
