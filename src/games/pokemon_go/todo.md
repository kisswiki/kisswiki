Unlike Ingress, where there is
- [ ] a continuing story line influenced by how well the two factions are doing
- [ ] a global score that every player can influence
- [ ] an in game chat function so players can interact without knowing each other ahead of time
- [ ] the ability for huge operations involving dozens of players
- [ ] the challenge of organizing such an operation
  - [ ] clearing lanes to make way for linking
  - [ ] capturing or destroying key portals
  - [ ] heading out to some obscure location in the middle of the night and feeling like a secret agent on a top secret mission

Pokemon Go really has very little to offer. On top of that
  - [ ] the tracking feature is not what the players wanted (and had at release). You basically go around capturing gyms, which serves no purpose...
  - [ ] the xp gained is not worth the potions you need to use to recover from the attack, so unless you are trying to get on multiple gyms to get your daily rewards, there is little point
  - [ ] You also go around hunting pokemon, which is not multiplayer in the slightest, except for the fact that your friends can do it with you
  - [ ] And you can only hunt so many pokemon before it gets redundant...
  - [ ] the xp requirements suddenly grow at a stupidly fast rate once you get to level 20.
  - [ ] It is extremely difficult to find new players as there is no way to communicate with them unless you happen to bump in to them.
  - [ ] If you live in a place far away from water, you essentially are locked out of some of the badges and pokemon (unlike ingress where all badges are accessible, even while urban play and rural play present different challenges).
