>gaming at 4K is a premium endeavour. You need a colossal amount of rendering power to game at decent frame rates and such high resolution. Even the high-end GeForce GTX 1080 fails to consistently produce 60+ fps across all games—that pursuit is better founded with twin 1080s at your disposal.

>IPS glow is annoying especially at the corners. The Acer at 100% brightness isn't as bad as the Asus at 50%.

>Jeden klient sklepu overclockers.co.uk napisal ze 3 razy wymienial Asusa ze wzgledu na backlight bleeding natomiast po 3 razem zdecydowal sie na Acera i od razu dostal dobra sztuke.

>Acer Predator mial nieco ponad 11ms a Asus wypadl jeszcze gorzej.

>Nie twierdzę, że jest to jakaś różnica ogromna, ale do grania wybrałbym dalej PG278Q. Szczególnie, że autor go miał i sobie chwali.

>We used a Leo Bodnar Video Signal Lag Tester to measure input lag (the time it takes for the monitor to react to a controller command), and the XB271HU delivered a negligible lag time of 12.5 milliseconds. Our fastest monitors, the BenQ SW2700PT$599.00 at Amazon and the BenQ XL2430T$383.58 at Walmart, both delivered a lag time of 9.5 milliseconds.

>I'd say go for the Acer as that seems to be what most have been using without much issues. I'm not certain what you mean by QC issues as the only issues seen were due to screen tearing/stuttering due to driver issues from GPU manufacturers. Asus on the other hand are known to have outstanding warranty support so an ROG based device should be replaced fairly quickly if there are any defects.
