No. Elm provides three super-types that work like typeclasses: number, comparable, and appendable. The Elm language does not allow for defining our own super-types.

The number type comprises Int and Float.

The comparable type comprises Int, Float, Char, String, List, and tuples5.

The appendable type comprises String, List, and text

There are three special lowercase types: number, comparable, and appendable.
- Numbers allow you to use arithmetic on Ints and Floats.
- Comparable allows you to order numbers and strings, like a < b.
- Appendable things can be combined with a ++ b.
