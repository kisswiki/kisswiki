## MDC

MDC is successor of MDL

>where does elm-mdl go in the absence of MDL v2? The obvious choice seem to be keep the API, port over the implementation to MDC. I don't understand what's up with web components and elm (last I tried, I couldn't get the former to work with virtual dom), and I'm unsure of the ramifications. Insights would be greatly appreciated.
