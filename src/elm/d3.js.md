## Problem

https://dev.to/rtfeldman/i-am-the-author-of-elm-in-action-ask-me-anything/comments

We are having trouble embedding components in our Elm applications. Working with ports is a great abstraction to help us protect the purity of our lovely Elm world. However, many of the projects I embed in my Elm project hook up event listeners to DOM elements. This causes memory leaks because there's no way for the component to know it's being unloaded.
