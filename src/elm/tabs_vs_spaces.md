Rejecting hard tabs altogether conveniently fixes the issue entirely, and provides the same visual experience no matter where elm code is viewed as

That's especially important given Elm's compiler has a strong tendency to echo your code back with decoration in error messages, mandating and enforcing spaces means a much easier time doing that.
