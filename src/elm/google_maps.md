> I'm curious if an approach with having a google map with its markers and position as a web component, say, via a Polymer library, will make everything easy.
This way we would somehow able to have a markup like <map lat="32" lng="23" zoom="3"><marker lat="2" lng="3" icon="1.png">Test</marker></map> which itself can be completely controlled from the elm. Of course someone need to add a binding to that map element, but that itself is another issue.
And, as I hope, there is nothing what prevents from making a Polymer or other web component using a compiled elm source!
