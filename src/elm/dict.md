- This is a dictionary based off of core's Dict implementation, except it can support any type, rather than just comparables. A function must be given which will hash the key into a comparable. https://github.com/eeue56/elm-all-dict

## case after get

`case Dict.get id model.displayables |> Maybe.map .view of`
