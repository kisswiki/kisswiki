## lua support

The Ubuntu repository version of MPV is not very good. It's old and lacks features such as on-screen display.

I use the latest version and it works perfectly. Install it like this:

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mc3man/trusty-media
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mpv
```
