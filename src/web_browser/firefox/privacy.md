## uBLock Origin vs Privacy Badger

Ublock Origin + Privacy Badger. Ublock Origin blocks ads and trackers based on a list of known trackers. As things change quickly, you can be had by trackers that arent yet in the lists used by Ublock Origin. Make no mistake- Ublock Origin is awesome for blocking ads, awesome for blocking trackers, awesome in advanced mode for tailoring access by website, awesome at blocking 3rd party stuff, etc. Definitely use it.

Privacy Badger uses heuristics to find trackers. So lets say a tracker pops up that isn't on Ublock Origin's lists yet and PB detects it multiple times- it will block that tracker. It also handles social media tracking buttons nicely.

Use both!
