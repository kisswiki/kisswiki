1. clause is limited to patent lawsuits.
2. You keep the protection given by grant if FB sues you first.
3. Facebook needs to find a patent that they own that relates to React to sue you for using React.
4. If you sue Facebook, it's only the patent grant that terminates. Without that you still have the BSD licence to use React under.

the one in Go basically says if you sue google for any Go related patents then they revoke the license. that patent retaliation clause is nothing different from the one used in Apache Licence Version 2. the one in react says they revoke your license when you sue facebook for any patent related matter.

Aslo called a "weak patent retaliation clause" vs React's (current) strong patent retaliation clause. I found the explanations in [1] to be very helpful to understand patent clauses. https://medium.com/@dwalsh.sdlr/react-facebook-and-the-revokable-patent-license-why-its-a-paper-25c40c50b562
