## What is `getComponent` in react-router?

>In React Router v2 and v3, we can use the getComponent method on routes to load split-out code bundles in parallel. There is no API for displaying feedback during this. After the code bundles have been loaded, we can use the Router middleware API to fetch data for all the routes in parallel. At this point, we can display loading state. https://medium.com/@taion/react-routing-and-data-fetching-ec519428135c

react-router lets us asynchronously specify components of <Route>s with a prop called getComponent. It takes a function with a location and a callback argument. react-router will only render ourComponent when we run callback(null, ourComponent).
```javascript
export default store => ({
  path: '/booking/tour-dates/:tourId',
  getComponent (...args) {
    const cb = args[1];
    require.ensure([], (require) => {
      const Container = require('./containers').default;

      cb(null, Container);
    }, 'tour-dates');
  },
});
```

Webpack gives us different ways to define split points, but the most usable one for our purposes is require.ensure. An example require.ensure might look something like this:

function loadModule() {
  require.ensure([], function(require) {
    var module = require('module.js');
  }, "MyModule");
}
The module exported in module.js will be in a second file generated by webpack, and loaded as soon as the require.ensure is called in the browser. (This wonâ€™t happen until our loadModule function gets called)
