## `useSelector` and `dispatch`

Use can use `useSelector` and `dispatch` instead of `connect` and `mapStateToProps` https://thoughtbot.com/blog/using-redux-with-react-hooks

## Hooks and stale closure

Hooks implementation assumes that between the component re-renderings, the latest closure supplied as a callback to the hook (e.g. useEffect(callback)) has captured the freshest variables from the componentâ€™s function scope.

## componentDidMount equivalent is useLayoutEffect

>This hook similar to the useEffect hook, however, it fires synchronously after all DOM mutations. It also renders in the same way as componentDidUpdate and componentDidMount.

## Using Set is problematic

Probably better to use array.

```javascript
  function handleMultiple(val, fn) {
    return function (checkedName) {
      const newVal = val.includes(checkedName)
        ? val.filter(name => name !== checkedName)
        : [...val, checkedName];;
      fn(newVal);
    };
  }
```
