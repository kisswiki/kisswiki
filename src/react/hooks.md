## `useSelector` and `dispatch`

Use can use `useSelector` and `dispatch` instead of `connect` and `mapStateToProps` https://thoughtbot.com/blog/using-redux-with-react-hooks

## Hooks and stale closure

Hooks implementation assumes that between the component re-renderings, the latest closure supplied as a callback to the hook (e.g. useEffect(callback)) has captured the freshest variables from the componentâ€™s function scope.

## componentDidMount equivalent is useLayoutEffect

> This hook similar to the useEffect hook, however, it fires synchronously after all DOM mutations. It also renders in the same way as componentDidUpdate and componentDidMount.

## Using Set is problematic

Probably better to use array.

```javascript
function handleMultiple(val, fn) {
  return function (checkedName) {
    const newVal = val.includes(checkedName)
      ? val.filter((name) => name !== checkedName)
      : [...val, checkedName];
    fn(newVal);
  };
}
```

## hooks, useState, useEffect and maximum update depth exceeded

I had problem with error `maximum update depth exceeded`.

Turned out, `useAssets` is using `useEffect`, so like in `What color is your function?`, or in book `Black Hat Rust` that async or lifetime annotations are like virus, you also need to have all chain of values like:

first variable uses useState -> second uses useState and useEffect to update itself when first changes -> and so on.

Ali told me:

> the arguments you pass to "useAssets" should have referential equality

```javascript
const { branches } = useCompanyBranches();

const [allBranchesIds, setAllBranchesIds] = useState(
  branches.map(({ id }) => id)
);

useEffect(() => {
  setAllBranchesIds(branches.map(({ id }) => id));
}, [branches]);

const [branchesChecked, setBranchesChecked] = useDependentState(allBranchesIds);

const [filtersChecked, setFiltersChecked] = useState({
  branches: branchesChecked,
});

useEffect(() => {
  setFiltersChecked({
    branches: branchesChecked,
  });
}, [branchesChecked]);

const { assets } = useAssets(searchTerm, filtersChecked);
```
