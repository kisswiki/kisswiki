If Facebook infringes on one of your software patents your choices are to rewrite your existing React code and sue them for damages or ignore it.

I think a good principle is to never assume malicious intent, but never tolerate an abusive position either.
So, Facebook, lets assume, isn't being malicious and genuinely feels this is the right approach to deal with what they consider to be "meritless" lawsuits... but at the same time, if this response-- genuine as it may be-- gives them abusive power, don't abide it.
Similar principle for politicians-- never support Obama/Trump having a power you wouldn't want Trump/Obama wielding.
For any aspect of power, assume the most abusive historical figure has it-- should they have it? IF not then don't grant it to even people you like.
