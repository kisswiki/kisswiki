> He's probably referring to the USB controller problem that has existed since day 1 in Pi, causing loss of USB data when peripherals of different USB versions are mixed. This requires USB split transactions to work in the host, but all Pi SoCs contain only a cut-down USB controller which requires hard realtime response in under 1ms from the ARM CPU, and this cannot be guaranteed in Linux. As a result, USB data is non-deterministically dropped on the floor under these circumstances, so mixed-version USB peripherals commonly stop working or work only intermittently.
It's a well known hardware limitation of USB on all Pi versions, and it has been fully described by the Pi developers. It is formally a hardware fault because USB2.0 compliance requires backwards compatibility with earlier versions of USB including correct operation with mixed versions, which Pi does not provide.
Everyone was hoping that when the Pi3 was released, the new 64-bit architecture would be accompanied by a full hardware USB controller not suffering that previous fault, an ideal opportunity for such change. Alas, it didn't happen, it still uses the same old half-baked one as before.
