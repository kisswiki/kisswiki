At Mapzen, all our code is open source, from front-end UIs to back-end "glue." Have a look at:
- web and mobile SDKs: http://github.com/mapzen/
- map rendering library: http://github.com/tangrams
- map tiles: https://github.com/tilezen/
- routing/navigation: https://github.com/valhalla/
- public transit: https://github.com/transitland/
- search/geocoding: http://github.com/pelias
- gazetteer: https://github.com/whosonfirst
FWIW, we do have a few private repos, to protect some ops internals as well as upcoming blog posts.
(I work at Mapzen -- and am also a happy user of Mapbox's open-source libraries.)
