Currently, there exists no cross-browser scroll bar CSS styling definitions. The W3C article I mention at the end has the following statement and was recently updated (Fri 10 Oct 2014 03:09:48 PM CEST):

Some browsers (IE, Konqueror) support the non-standard properties 'scrollbar-shadow-color', 'scrollbar-track-color' and others. These properties are illegal: they are neither defined in any CSS specification nor are they marked as proprietary (by prefixing them with "-vendor-")
