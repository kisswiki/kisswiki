> HKT won't give Rust the magical ability to actually express "monads" either.
> One could even argue that Rust can't express FP because it doesn't have "functions" in t hat sense, only "procedures" with typeclasses to abstract over them and data structures. In fact, the only language feature that really qualifies as "functional" is closures, mainly used to parametrize imperative-procedural abstractions and contraptions (as sugar, if you will), instead of being directly composed.

> At the end of the day, FP cargo-culting is just as bad as its OOP cousin, and therein lies the irony of XY: why are you following a big-idea design pattern to solve your problem instead of attacking the problem directly, in a sugary imperative world?
