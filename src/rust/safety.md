> Our analysis of the security benefit of Rust comes from two very simple, empirical facts:
> 1. Apps written in memory-safe languages do not have nearly the same numbers of memory safety bugs (use after free, heap overflow, etc.) as apps written in C and C++ do.
> 2. Memory safety issues make up the largest number of critical RCE bugs in browser engines.

> Rust is a tool to defend against memory safety vulnerabilities. It's also a tool to make systems programming more accessible to programmers who aren't long-time C++ experts and to make concurrent and parallel programming in large-scale systems more robust.
