## 203 vs 302

right now the 302 is really not worth it anymore.
if you like that shape, might as well spend a little more for the 303, since that has dropped price in many places too.
the 203/102 uses a more advanced sensor than any of the current sensor. but logitech (I feel) is purposely making it in a budget version to test the waters. but due to the advanced tech, it manage to perform almost as good as the 3366, while being cheaper to produce.

## sniper button, dpi, etc.

The top button, AKA the DPI button, AKA the “sniper button” is a little button behind the scroll wheel. It’s far back enough to where you wouldn’t really hit it while scrolling so there’s no problem there. I will say that the click feels a bit plastic though. Not the most satisfying click. It’s not a huge issue though. It’s not a button people hit all that often.

While the Pro’s DPI can be cranked from 200 to 12,000, the G203 only goes from 200 to 6,000

There’s no smoothing, predictive movements, acceleration, or built in angle snapping detectable in the G203. The movements you make are translated to the screen basically flawlessly. Its job is to be true to your movements. And it does a great job. I feel like I’m in control of the mouse at all times.
