I wore a pair of Sony MDR-7506, the ubiquitous radio cans, for 8+ hours every day while operating and editing talk radio and didn’t even notice, despite the job calling for constantly necking them and then putting them back. And I have a large head. They’re ubiquitous in radio for a reason.

## planar

In the past, planar magnetic headphones were what you had to get in order to have good bass response - they were the only ones that had full bass extension down to 20hz, while dynamic drivers would commonly roll off below 50hz. These days, however, some enthusiasts actually prefer the bass response of dynamic driver headphones. The reason for this is that while you do get inherently better bass extension with planar magnetic headphones, many modern planars don't have quite as much punch or slam as dynamic driver counterparts.

There are of course a number of exceptions to this, like the high end Audeze LCD-4 or HiFiMAN Susvara (and several others). However the trend for many newer planar headphones is that often what they gain in terms of efficiency and comfort compared to their older counterparts, they lose in dynamic impact (the 'punch' or slam quality). At the moment, it's unclear to me what causes this difference, it may be due to the prevalence of single-sided arrays with less magnetic force being exerted on the diaphragm, or it could be due to physical properties of the diaphragm itself.

As technology advances, we're getting thinner and thinner material for the diaphragm, and this allows planars to become more efficient, and also use lighter magnets (so that they're lighter overall). But this trade off also may be responsible for less slam and punch.
