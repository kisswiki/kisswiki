The "fullscreen" screen area is the 16:10 that results from subtracting the notch height. The area left and right of the notch is strictly for the menu bar and will be blanked out on video or full-screen apps.

If we subtract 74 pixels from their heights, we get 3456 by 2160 and 3024 by 1890, both of which are 1.6. So I'm guessing the notch is 74 pixels high?

16/10 = 1.6

16/9 = 1.777
