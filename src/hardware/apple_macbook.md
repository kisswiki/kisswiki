## M1

The "fullscreen" screen area is the 16:10 that results from subtracting the notch height. The area left and right of the notch is strictly for the menu bar and will be blanked out on video or full-screen apps.

I guess that if you auto-hide the menu bar, a black strip will mask the area.

If we subtract 74 pixels from their heights, we get 3456 by 2160 and 3024 by 1890, both of which are 1.6. So I'm guessing the notch is 74 pixels high?

16:10 is closer to two A4 side by side

420/297 = 1.414

16/10 = 1.6

16/9 = 1.777

## External monitor

If you want text to be as “crisp” as possible, you want the highest pixel density you can get. For 27”, that means a 5K (5120×2880) monitor with 219 pixels per inch (ppi). The LG UltraFine 5K is the only 5K monitor still available AFAIK.

## Heat and throttling

There is another video [1], in which a 2017 i7 outperforms a 2018 i9 in video compression due to its severe throttling. Sure the benchmarks look great and are better on the i9, but as someone mentioned, that's like looking at sprint compared to a longer race.
