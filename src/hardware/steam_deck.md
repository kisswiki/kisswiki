  - Steam Deck just doesn’t have the horsepower for the Switch version of BOTW. It’s why we all use CEMU to play it.
- [Which is better for BOTW? Yuzu or Cemu? : cemu](https://www.reddit.com/r/cemu/comments/wvl9qa/which_is_better_for_botw_yuzu_or_cemu/)
  - Cemu had more developement time is thus a bit more mature than Yuzu, and BotW specifically has been optimized to death on Cemu because it's arguably one of the only three or four Wii U games that anyone is actually interested in playing.

  - Cemu is wiiu, yuzu is switch
  - Cemu for games that are on both switch and Wii U
