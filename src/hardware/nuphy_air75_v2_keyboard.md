## Connect with VIA

> I also found that sometimes when using https://usevia.app the keyboard wouldn't connect. I fixed this by re-uploading the .json file to the design tab and making sure the keyboard was unplugged when doing this. When the popup in Google Chrome comes up to select a keyboard I would then plug in the usb cable (That came with my keyboard) into the keyboard itself (Making sure it was in wired mode before hand.). https://github.com/the-via/releases/issues/290#issuecomment-2116442716

Separate VIA app from homebrew didn't work.
