## Maybe battery life will improve with Qualcomm modems or Apple's own modems

>Apple was originally planning to use Intel's 5G chips in its 2020 iPhones, due to an ongoing lawsuit with Qualcomm but Intel exited the 5G chip market. Apple settled its disagreement with Qualcomm and will now be using Qualcomm's 5G chips in its 2020 iPhone lineup. https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/2019-iphones/

And in the future Apple will probably have their own modems:

- >According to The Telegraph Sunday, a leaked email reveals that Apple poached Umashankar Thyagarajan, Intel’s lead developer of 5G technology, mere weeks before the iPhone maker settled the royalties legal battle with Qualcomm. Thyagarajan now is an "architectuer at Apple," as listed on his Linkedin profile.

- >According to a previous Bloomberg report, the reason Apple ended-up in a settlement with Qualcomm was not necessarily because the company thought it was losing the legal battle, but because Intel was failing to deliver a competitive 5G chip on time. (...) Intel doesn’t seem to do very well in any business that has a low dollar margin. Intel has already learned this the hard way in the smartphone chip market. Its Atom chip was never price-competitive without heavy subsidies from the company, making it lose billions of dollars every year. Some of its IoT attempts also haven’t fared so well, either.

- >The report also made it clear that Apple's not the only one questioning its relationship with Intel. Fast Company said the chipmaker has struggled to meet Apple's demands, especially the one that requires its orders to be prioritized over Intel's other customers. The companies negotiated a sweetheart deal when it came to wireless modems, which means Intel's profits are minimal. Prioritizing a low-profit customer is... challenging. https://www.tomshardware.com/news/apple-intel-relationship-5g-iphone-modems,38989.html
