## Apple

Apple has an architecture license. I don't know what the terms of the license are but it allows Apple to develop architecture compliant chips. They were one of the original developers of the original ARM and held a large stock position in ARM Ltd.

Do we know what Apple is paying? Remember that ARM started as a joint project from Acorn, Apple, and VLSI. Apple certainly held a full architecture license from founding, despite not designing one until comparatively recently, which to me implies there's some specific license.
I certainly assume they weren't paying large amounts for a license when relatively poor in the 90s despite holding one.

## Then how come ARM won on mobile?

Because an enterprising engineer managed to hand code an assembly language implementation of cellular baseband on ARM thus entrenching ARM as the low cost implementation on a cell phone. After that, ARM expanded outward to run the GUI.
In addition, the batteries of the time demanded a specific power envelope. Not many chips had this envelope ... pretty much only ARM , MIPS, and a handful of also rans that you've never heard of.

Once ARM got going, network effects took over. There is no reason you couldn't implement a cell phone on a MIPS core, for example, at this point except for network effects.
