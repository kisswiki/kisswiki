## Send file to archive

send mobi file to your email at kindle.com.

Or you can use SendToKindle apps https://www.amazon.com/gp/sendtokindle.

This way you can send up to 50MB file.

To install it on Windows 10 you need first to open cmd.exe as Administrator and run:

```
sc config Spooler binPath=%windir%\system32\spoolsv.exe
```

Otherwise you will get error "We are having difficulty starting spooler on your computer, un-installation cannot proceed."
