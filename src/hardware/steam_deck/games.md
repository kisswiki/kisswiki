Fabulously Optimized modpack: `Desktop Mode > Discover > Prism Launcher > Install` then `Add Instance > window will open and on the left click Mondrinth > select Fabulously Optimized > Ok`. https://fabulously-optimized.gitbook.io/modpack/readme/install-instructions#steam-deck

Controller setup: with Fabulously Optimized there is MidnightControls mod. Go to `Minecraft > Options > Controls > click on gamepad icon > Mode: Controller`. Left trigger to move does not work in Desktop Mode.

To have left touchpad click working as right-mouse button click: `steam button > edit controller setup > left touchpad > click: right-mouse button click`.

Brightness: `edit instance > Mods > Add file > boosted-brightness-2.1.3+1.19.3.jar` downloaded from https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/boosted-brightness/files. Then go to `Minecraft > Mods > Boosted Brightness > on the right you have to click icon with sliders > set brightness`. You can bind shorcuts for brightness setting in game pad settings.

To rename instance: `right-click on instance (steam button + left trigger) > Rename` or `click instance > click on instance name on the right`.

To locate resources folder: `Desktop Mode > Prism Launcher > Minecraft > Options > Resource Packs > Open Pack Folder`. https://modrinth.com/resourcepacks

To locate shader packs folder: `Desktop Mode > Prism Launcher > Minecraft > Options > Video Settings > on the top right click Shader Packs`. https://modrinth.com/shaders

To move worlds from one instance to another: `Desktop Mode > Prism Launcher > click on instance > Folder > hamburger menu > Show Hidden files > open .minecraft folder`.

To close Prism Launcher in Game Mode: `steam button > Exit game`.

To make Prism Launcher start instance: `Desktop Mode > Prism Launcher > select instance > on the right click Folder.` Remember the folder name that was opened. For me it is "Fabulously Optimized". Go to `Game Mode > click icon near  Prism Launcher > LAUNCH OPTIONS > at the end add -l "Fabulously Optimized"`

BONUS

4GB VRAM: `Hold Volume UP and press Power Once while the Deck is turned off > Setup Utility > Advanced > UMA > 4G > Save & Exit`
