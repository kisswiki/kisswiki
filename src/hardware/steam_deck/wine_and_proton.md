## Proton GE

Some games are supported only by https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom.

`Desktop mode > Discover > ProtonUp-Qt > install Proton GE beta`

There is button game list, but setting it here does nothing. You need to choose proton ge in game settings in steam.

## proton versions

Glorius Egrolls proton (proton-ge) was designed to enable features for games earlier than they might appear in regular proton. A big goal of him is to be as compatible as possible with older builds but still get more and more games running.

- proton-tkg (currently based on wine 5.11 if you use the scripts) = development version
- proton-ge (currently based on wine 5.9) = beta version (but with ideas valve never might add)
- proton (currently based on wine 5.0) = release version (but with work not released before the release)
