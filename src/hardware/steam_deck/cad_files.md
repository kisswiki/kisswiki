No you can't The case is a "full" 3d model used to get an idea how the Steam deck looks. These are not part level. So you don't have just the back shell seperately with screw holes etc at the correct location. Afaik no one even has ever made a custom back panel for the steam deck.

@Harm van Vliet This is true. It was kind of a letdown. The CAD files weren't the step files. They were just the solid objects to work around.
