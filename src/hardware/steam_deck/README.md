## Proton GE

Some games are supported only by https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom.

`Desktop mode > Discover > ProtonUp-Qt > install Proton GE beta`

There is button game list, but setting it here does nothing. You need to choose proton ge in game settings in steam.

## Clear binding for left touchpad click

Press x.

## Hard restart of steam deck

Press power button for 20s, wait 5 minutes.

## Battery life and performance

Limit refresh rate to 40Hz and fps to 40. Limit TDP.

Use Decky Settings https://steamdecklife.com/2023/01/10/decksettings-steam-deck-game-settings/ to see optimal settings for you, either for battery or performance.

Look at remaining time in 3rd level of Performance Overlay https://www.partitionwizard.com/partitionmanager/steam-deck-fps.html

## FSR

To get it to work, you have to LOWER the native resolution. It’s 1280x800 I’m pretty sure at standard, so lower that by like two notches to like 1120 x something or lower, hit the 3 dots button, go to performance and scroll to the bottom until You see the option for fsr. It’ll be this bar that has a couple of options, one of them saying “integer” You will know it’s activated when the actual resolution of your screen changes, since FSR is an upscaler. With FSR, I’m able to play way more AAA games like the Witcher 3 at a almost rock solid 60fps. Really awesome shit that people should utilize.
