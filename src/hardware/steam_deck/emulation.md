      - Turning it to 3 threads is good enough fyi
  - game mode has a tweak to expose the CPU as 8c/8t instead of 4c/8t. This lets several games pick 6 or 8 threads instead of 4, yielding big gains from SMT scaling. Helps performance in HZD, Cyberpunk https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/steam-deck-client-update-out-plus-valve-dev-clarifies-a-tweak-for-gaming-mode/
  - There are performance improvements in the pipe on workloads that need SMT disabled to perform well. Those are being tested now and will release as part of the updated kernel we are working on for SteamOS 3.5. https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1626041563737645056

  - Steam Deck just doesn’t have the horsepower for the Switch version of BOTW. It’s why we all use CEMU to play it.
- [Which is better for BOTW? Yuzu or Cemu? : cemu](https://www.reddit.com/r/cemu/comments/wvl9qa/which_is_better_for_botw_yuzu_or_cemu/)
  - Cemu had more developement time is thus a bit more mature than Yuzu, and BotW specifically has been optimized to death on Cemu because it's arguably one of the only three or four Wii U games that anyone is actually interested in playing.

  - Cemu is wiiu, yuzu is switch
  - Cemu for games that are on both switch and Wii U
