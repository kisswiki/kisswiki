TLDR: Glove80 wins for me.

I'm not the kind to write long detailed reviews, so I'm just going to quickly jot down why, after a month of switching back and forth between the two, the Glove80 is now my go-to keyboard.

- The feel/ergonomics/physical layout is much better. The factors that I can identify contributing to this are more sensible choices for 1. the curve of the well 2. default pronation angle 3. layout of the keys. These are all clear improvements over the 360.
- One of the most obvious improvements is the angle of the palm rest relative to horizonal. On the 360 (on all the Advantage models actually, I've used them since v1) this angle somehow feels too steep and my hand doesn't rest on the keyboard that well; on the Glove80, my whole hand rests very nicely.
- Reaching every key is even easier on the Glove80. For example, going to 'B' on the 360 now feels awkward than the same key on the Glove80.
- The revamped thumb cluster is a big win: now all 6 keys are easily accessible.
- I get 80 keys vs 76 keys, All in a more sensible layout - columns are longer and easier to reach, This vs the kb360 where the rows are longer and I have to move more to reach the keys on the inside of each half.
- Using choc keys with less vertical travel leads to much a better typing experience - less movement, better keypress confirmation, less "wobbly" keypress. Sure there are probably ways to mod "standard" height keys to achieve a similar effect...but I don't want to have to do those things.
- I can't comment on having to adjust the tenting, because I haven't needed to adjust from the default configuration. Should that count as a plus point?

Another huge kudos to Stephen: I had hardware problems with my unit and he patiently spent a few hours on Discord with me (sometimes on a video call) to troubleshoot. Awesome customer service.

Incidentally, the hardware problems were what made me have to switch back and forth between the 360 and the Glove80, and I can say that after switching a few times I developed a clear preference for the Glove80.

If'm very happy with my Glove80. I started with a prototype 3D printed model last year: the creators are friends of mine, and I wrote the LED status display code for them. I also dropped the prototype down a flight of concrete stairs (sorry! It still works though).

I now have a production model with the white clicky keyswitches. Ultra happy with it. I've been using Kinesis Advantage2s for a shade over two decades - the same model DanielDK used for a long time. The Glove80 is simply better. I prefer the clicky keyswitches. Ergonomics are great. It's really repairable - everything is held together with screws (spare parts for my Advantage2s are not available, and the function keys are not repairable). Open firmware so you can make it do wacky stuff if the need arises. Small and light enough for travel - I should get a proper case but it's survived a fair few trips stuffed into my backpack.

Yeah, adaptation to new keyboard layouts is hard. I used a layout that mimicked my old Advantage2 - so I'd paid the cost to learn columnar already. I found the default Glove80 layout was better, but switching meant a month of confusing Ctrl and Shift. All better now!

The geometry is better, your hands and fingers rest more comfortably. Kinesis keywell is different than glove. It's a little more curved, but also more cramped. In the beginning, the glove 80 felt a bit weird, but after a while I think the geometry is superior.

It has much lower height than kinesis, which removes the shoulder strain that kinesis often imposes.

The keys are also much lower in height, which (despite the same actuation force of the switches) removes some of the actual force required to type and so feels more like typing on a thinkpad or mac.

The thumb cluster is still not optimal for my small-medium hands, but MUCH more comfortable than kinesis.

Alright, a lot of people went straight for the "which one did you pick" question so I'll go ahead and share my experience.

Contrary to popular opinion, I prefer the Kinesis Advantage 360 by a wide margin, and will not be keeping the Glove80.

My background: I’ve spent almost 10 years working exclusively on chunky tenkeyless boards with MX Browns. I haven’t modded any boards, I don’t game or use niche/specialized/enthusiast software. My line of work requires a ton of mousing, writing LOTS of documentation, and about 30% scripting/coding/CLI. I have to keep customization to a minimum (different client sites where I have to use their keyboards, lots of remote sessions, VMs, multiple OS's, etc) which means that memorizing layers and alternate layouts would do me more harm than good. I prefer to have most keys in standard locations with the exception of the few that cause the most pain (Enter, Backspace, Ctrl, arrow keys) which both MoErgo and Kinesis put in better places by default.

Like others, I started developing wrist pain, and researched ergo keyboards for weeks, skipping the Dactyls and DIY kits (no time and not interested) and settled on the two prebuilt, curved keywell, adjustable tilt columnar mechanical keyboards on the market: Glove80 and Kinesis Advantage 360. Surprisingly, the whole internet appeared to be unanimous in its reviews: the Advantage is great, but the Glove80 is cheaper while being “better in every way”, and “making the Advantage 360 obsolete.” After reading up on all the research and hundreds of prototypes MoErgo went through, I followed the consensus and ordered the Glove80 Rev2 with the “brown tactile switches”. At first, I didn’t love how the keys felt at all, the switches were not good but tolerable if everything else worked out, and I thought the threaded tilt might be a problem if different angles worked better for the different sit/stand positions of my desk. 2 weeks later, none of those thoughts had been changed or disproven. While the Glove80 confirmed that this type of keyboard was what I needed for the pain (it disappeared), there was enough bugging me that made me consider trying the Kinesis. What pushed me over the edge was the constant thought of "Man, if only this had the keys and MX Browns from any of my other keyboards" I went back to Youtube and watched a video of someone typing on the Advantage 360 and my gut told me that it was exactly what I kept wishing for. I ordered it, received in 2 days, and it wasn't just the keys that felt how I imagined they would - the overall design, default layout, build, and ergonomics were a good 40-50% better for my anatomy, style of work, and adjustment needs. Night and day, immediately, no question. (Edit: by "anatomy" I mean my wide, beefy, gorilla monster truck hands)

First, there's the aspect that the Glove80 really is like a glove in the sense that it feels more like I'm "inserting" my hand into a molded 3D space where I can't (or shouldn't want to) move. I know that this is by design and is what makes it so "comfortable" to many reviewers. Here's where my case is a bit different: On a typical day, I rarely go more than 90 seconds without taking a hand off the keyboard for the reasons I mentioned above, and on the Glove80 it feels like there's a careful "undocking" and "docking" process to get back in position, and even after 2 weeks, that process takes just a little too long, long enough that it gets frustrating, especially on emergency meetings where the right hand is bouncing back and forth constantly. The Kinesis' slightly shallower keywell gives just a little more room so that I can "undock" much more naturally, and the traditional contoured keys let my fingers know they're home immediately whereas on the Chocs I had to "search" more since all the keys feel the same. Then there's the tenting. As I suspected on Day 1 with the Gloves, different angles feel better at different desk heights. The highest and lowest quick tenting options on the Kinesis, however, were good for both desk heights and took 5 seconds to adjust. Now, If I were strictly a dev at a static desk with one OS and I could go all day without using a mouse, this section would have been different, so don’t let this influence your decision if your work style is different from mine.

Then there’s the controversial point: The physical build - but probably not what you’re thinking. I have no problem with the Glove80 not being "heavy" or not taking "premium" inspiration from supercars. My issue is that, as mere physical objects sharing a busy desk with books, cables, phones, glasses, remotes, and multiple laptops shuffling around every day, the Glove80's presence introduces a small but significant level of stress-inducing delicacy to my work area. It’s like tiptoeing around your house at night knowing there's a half-built Lego set on the ground somewhere, whereas the Kinesis units are like pieces of furniture. What I mean is this: unlike the Kinesis, the Glove80 doesn’t tolerate being bumped into or touched anywhere or by anything other than hands on the keys and wrist rests, because doing so will:A) knock them out of those perfect spots that took forever to find, and:B) scrape and scratch soft materials like…skin, which is an element that I never see mentioned online - The Glove80 has some SHARP edges and corners. When I tried to use my mouse/trackball/trackpad in the center of the 2 halves, or if I reached around the corners to grab something, scraping my knuckles or forearm on super hard, super sharp plastic didn't feel great. My infant daughter sometimes sits on my lap and plays with stuff on my desk, and I would consider the Glove80 dangerous in the hands of a small child. There's also a sharp point that protrudes up right next to the innermost thumb keys where my thumbs go to rest/fidget, and that is very uncomfortable. The Kinesis units are smooth and rounded, and they stay put, like they were designed to live on real working desks and bump shoulders with coffee mugs and watches and be home base for heavy, fidgety, active hands all day without the risk of…abrasion? These may sound like nitpicks or be irrelevant to you, in which case the Glove80 might be a good fit, but I'm just sharing observations because these things can add up over a long period of time.

Finally, there are the keys and switches themselves. I'm sure there's a good reason why they went with wide, flat, shallow keys, but I type much more comfortably and confidently on traditional contoured keycaps where my fingertips are gripped onto each key and receive all the feedback from the travel and bump in each switch. This was proven by a 15-20% increase in WPM within an hour of pivoting from the Glove80 (fine-tuned over 2 weeks) to the Kinesis (right out of the box). The thumb clusters on the Kinesis are more comfortable for my hands as well. More details on that are in my reply to u/FigitC . This obviously won’t be the case for everyone, but it’s important to consider if you’re a general user like me who’s coming from years of happily typing on chunky tactile switches and just wants to keep it going with the best out-of-the-box solution that’ll eliminate your pain.

My honest recommendations for the everyday user who does not plan on modding, owns/likes prebuilt mechanical keyboards, knows the purpose of these 2 keyboards, understands the learning curve, etc, and just wants to buy one to be their daily driver and help with pain:

- If you already own the Glove80 or the Kinesis 360, and don’t have any complaints on their physical day-to-day use that make you consider getting rid of them, stick with what you have unless you're just curious. You probably picked the right one.
-
- If you’re considering the Glove80 and my issues with it (too light/delicate for a busy desk, sharp edges and corners, shallow laptop-like keys) don’t bother you, get the Glove80, especially if you’re coming from shallow keys already.
-
- If my issues with the Glove80 sound like they might bother you, they probably will. Get the Kinesis first, try it for a few weeks, and if you have a lot of complaints or feel like it’d be way better if your keypresses felt more like typing on a Macbook/less resistant keys, or if it doesn’t help with the pain, return it and try the Glove80.
-
- If you’re considering the Advantage 360 and feel like what you see in the pics/videos would be a good fit for you, ignore the reviews and get it first, especially if you’re coming from tactile MX switches. It looks, feels, and sounds exactly how you think it will, if not better. The 3 tenting positions are plenty, the thumb cluster is fine, and if it doesn't work for you, you’ll know long before the return window is up.
-
- If you’re torn and the specs aren’t swaying you in either direction, pull up test/review videos for each, jump to scenes where you see and hear typing on these keyboards clearly, and just order the one that your gut says you’ll like more, because you’ll probably be right. I had no major surprises with either keyboard and wish I had gone with my gut from the start.

Note that I didn’t incorporate my opinions about sound, looks, software, connectivity, portability, warranties, durability, customer service, extras in the box, etc. This is because I was willing to compromise on any/all of them in exchange for the best tool to help me do my job without pain, and I think that taking this approach will help you find your best fit too.

Thanks for your detailed comparison!

> "Man, if only this had the keys and MX Browns from any of my other keyboards" I went back to Youtube and watched a video of someone typing on the Advantage 360 and my gut told me that it was exactly what I kept wishing for.

This part surprised me. As a user of the Kinesis Advantage2, I bought the 360 Pro, thinking it would be the most logical next step. After months of trying the 360, I couldn't get over how miserable the Gateron Browns on the 360 were. Typing on them was just very tiring.

I did some measurements (that I later found confirmed by rtings.com and others) and found that the Gateron Browns actuate closer to 3mm than the 2mm in Gateron's specifications. And it's not like my 360 Pro was a bad batch, I also measured a non-Pro 360 and it had the same issue. The 360 was so tiring to type on because they required my fingers to do more work/move larger distances.

In the end I started disliking the 360 Pro so much for this reason that it ended up collecting dust and I started using my KinTed Advantage2 again (despite not having a variable split or variable tenting). (Well, until I bought a Glove80).

I can agree though that Choc Browns are not great. I wonder how you'd look back on the experience if you had a proper tactile switch (like the Sunsets) or some completely different switch.

> The Kinesis' slightly shallower keywell gives just a little more room so that I can "undock" much more naturally, and the traditional contoured keys let my fingers know they're home immediately whereas on the Chocs I had to "search" more since all the keys feel the same.

Did you consider using homing keys on the home row as training wheels? (I am not sure how much it'd help, I don't have this issue with the Glove at all.)

> B) scrape and scratch soft materials like…skin, which is an element that I never see mentioned online

FWIW, my 360 Pro had scratches after a few days (and more once I started using the magnetic palm rests), while my Glove80 doesn't have a single scratch after >6 months. I don't want to invalidate what you are saying, but I was quite unhappy that my >600 Euro keyboard scratched so easily.

> Then there's the tenting. As I suspected on Day 1 with the Gloves, different angles feel better at different desk heights. The highest and lowest quick tenting options on the Kinesis, however, were good for both desk heights and took 5 seconds to adjust.

Agreed. This is an annoyance that I have too. The pro of the Glove80 is that the tenting doesn't add significant height (which the 360 does) and that you can microtune it to your liking (I could never find the right angle on the 360, since it was between two of the settings). But man would it be nice if it was easier to change the angle quickly on the Glove80. (I'd love something like the Moonlander Platform.)

@BikeForCoffee

I have gorilla-like hands with giant meaty palms and blunt, inarticulate thumbs. I can't text one-handed. They are not typical hands, and not even typical "big hands", but they aren't that uncommon. For MY hands, the Kinesis thumb cluster is much less tiring, because on the Glove, the stretch to the furthest thumb keys starts to hurt at the end of the day. This is because of how they chose to lay them out. On the Kinesis, I can reach out my thumb and hit Pg Dn with the inner edge of the knuckle and bend my thumb to hit Pg Up with the tip. On the Glove, jumping between the equivalent of those outer keys requires a lift and pivot at the lower thumb joint that eventually gets sore. So yes, the Glove80's thumb cluster is preferable for most hand sizes, large and small, but if you have XL, beefy hands (think construction workers, mechanics, landscapers, weight lifters, etc) and your thumbs are more like small elbows than fingers, the Kinesis-style thumb cluster might be a better fit.
