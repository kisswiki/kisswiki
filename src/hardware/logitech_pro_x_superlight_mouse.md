## usb radio receiver

> It won't work, have just tested this myself using Onboard Memory Manager. The Superlight uses a CU0021 receiver whilst the rest of the Lightspeed range uses a CU0008 receiver. https://www.reddit.com/r/MouseReview/comments/q55d0x/comment/hg3cl1k/

> For some idiotic reason, G305 and the Superlight need their own receivers.
> ALL other Lightspeed receivers are inter-compatible with all other Lightspeed mice, like the:
> G502 LS, G603, G604, G703, G903 and OG G Pro Wireless

> We are currently out of stock with spare lightspeed receivers, we would request you to check back with us in 2-3 weeks as the stock gets upgraded in the meantime. You could also check for a spare with an online/ third party retailer. https://www.reddit.com/r/LogitechG/comments/ono829/comment/h5t9fui/

> Onboard Memory Manager: https://support.logi.com/hc/en/articles/360059641133
> Finally using the onboard memory manager and repairing the mouse worked. The connection utility never picked anything up.

> Try the following:
>
> - Unplug and re plug the receiver use 2.0 USB port or directly at the back of your computer
> - Reconnect the mouse with the receiver.
> - Download the Logitech Connection Utility Software. Just click the link below https://download01.logi.com/web/ftp/>- pub/techsupport/mouse/ConnectUtility_2.30.9_Logitech.exe
> - Plug the receiver on a 2.0 USB port
> - Open the software then click next then follow the on screen instructions
> - Test the receiver on a different computer if possible
