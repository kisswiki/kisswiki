My recent adventure was trying to use a allyx with those miracle cables. VRR only works connected directly to the tv because it does not have a proper vrr implementation, only "freesync".
Using that solution, I immediately lose proper dts of any kind audio passthrough because LG oleds don't passthrough dts via earc.
It's a mess.

Just put a hdmi 2.1 capable AVR in the middle of your gpu and the TV and you are literally forced to use a nvidia card because they actually have a proper hdmi 2.1 with VRR implementation under linux.

The licensing group that controls the HDMI standard, the HDMI Forum, has reportedly told AMD that it does not allow an open source implementation of the HDMI 2.1 (or HDMI 2.1+) specification, blocking tools such as AMD's FreeSync from working over HDMI connections at resolution/rate combinations like 4K at 120 Hz, or 5K at 240 Hz.
