## About

> The 5 minute break is there if you want it, I pride myself on most of the time have a quick 30sec-1 minute break and then getting back to it to smash out another pomodoro with undivided attention.
>
> I would not advocate switching to another task for the next pomodoro unless you have completed what you set out to achieve.
>
> Also be specific with the task, specific enough that you can actually complete itâ€™s scope within 4 pomodoros. That way you create flow and keep pushing forward hard.

> David Allen tells you up front that he is not addressing procrastination. The time boxing concept directly confronts execution and procrastination. The author of Pomodoro Technique, invites us to "keep it simple" when it comes to writing down Activities, daily to-dos and record keeping for metrics.
>
> However, I'm truncating some of the lists of "actions" that I used to put into my GTD software. I'm looking to the GTD software as more "big picture" planning from 10,000 to 50,000 feet and for goal work.

> Productivity, at the basic level of working vs. not working, is not something you can best elicit through clever tricks and techniques; it depends on your physical capacity more than anything else.
>
> The reason many of us like to procrastinate is because we want to move from activities requiring lots of mental effort to activities requiring less mental effort. Ask yourself this: When you think about starting to work, do you (a) feel you could easily do it, but you decide to do something else instead, or do you (b) feel that you find it hard to bring up the mental strength to start working, so you spend time with less demanding activities instead.
>
>Most people pretend that the answer is (a), but usually the answer is (b), otherwise you wouldn't have much of a problem.
>
>If you don't feel like working because you "lack the mental strength", the problem is very similar to not being willing to run five miles, or not being willing to lift a large barbell: Mental work requires you to shift blood to your brain, while physical work requires you to shift blood to your muscles. In both cases your cardiovascular fitness determines, more than anything else, how hard it feels for you to do it.
>
>Mental effort, willpower and mental endurance are not unrelated to your body, but are directly related to physical parameters such as cerebral blood flow and neurotransmitter levels. Train your cardiovascular system and you'll find it easier to start working on whatever you want. I recommend high-intensity interval training (HIIT) at least 3 times a week, details are beyond the scope of this answer but can be found easily. Long-term exercise will physically strenghten your heart, allowing your body to pump more blood through your body, including your brain, which means you'll be more awake, more energetic, more determined, and feel less challenged by complex or boring mental tasks.
>
>Techniques such as the Pomodoro technique are similar to using supportive belts to lift weights, or running with special shoes that make you faster: They might make the task at hand a bit easier, but ultimately they are only an aid, no replacement for your own capacity.

>1. The pauses are supposed to keep you energized, so that you don't burn out from your work. These are useful to take a drink, free your mind from small things that came up during your work. Examples are putting tasks you came up with in your inbox of your GTD list or making a phone call with your wife, doing these small things in the 5 minutes will keep you energized and free from focus distractions.
>2. You achieve involvement by committing to the work you are planning to do in your Pomodoro.
>3. The Pomodoro Technique is supposed to help you towards success, by managing the flow of time.
>
>Having no pauses at will demotivate you over time which will break down the flow you are trying to achieve.

>When you follow the procedure - switching between concentration and relaxation breaks, you can keep being productive for long enough. When you start working longer - you can get exausted more quickly and that will bite you at the end of the day, when you attention starts to wander and you cannot really concentrate.
>
>Many people say they don't want to pause when they are coding or debugging. Maybe that's true for them. For me, I've found out that I can easily recall the context after 5 minutes break. Also, sometimes this break and switching attention brings to a sudden insight on where the bug is.

>break up my tasks into half-hour-ISH chunks, then take a break for a few minutes. Then back to work. If I find myself distracted during one of the half-hour-ish chunks, distracted to the point that I know I won't be effective, I'll take a break or a twenty-minute power nap.

>In various work groups which experimented with the Pomodoro Technique in mentoring activities, each team was allowed to choose the length of their own Pomodoro on the condition that this choice had to be based on observations regarding effectiveness. Generally, the teams started off with hour-long Pomodoros (25 minutes seemed too short at first), then moved to 2 hours, then down to 45 minutes, then 10, till they finally settled on 30 minutes.
