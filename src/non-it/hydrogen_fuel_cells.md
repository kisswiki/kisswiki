Other things that the hydrogen industry tries to keep a secret . . .
1) A typical hydrogen production station of 130 kg per day can only fuel 26 FCEVs per day or 4 Class 8 trucks
2) The third or fourth car in a fueling queue has to wait 15 or 20 minutes for the refueling tanks to re pressurize to 700 bar
3) Many/most gas stations do not have sufficient land area to accommodate a hydrogen dispensing operation for just 25 vehicles per day
4) A typical hydrogen production facility that could produce 130 kg of hydrogen per day (to support 270 vehicles at 50 km per day) costs $2.9 million USD - not including land costs
5) The hydrogen tanks in the vehicles have an expiry date rendering the entire vehicle scrap at that point
6) Hydrogen fuel stack performance degrades over time and would have to be replaced or more likely the vehicle would be scrapped due to the cost
7) Due to the danger, it is unlikely that hydrogen production stations would ever be allowed in built up areas

The source is the hydrogen tank on the Toyota MIRAI. It has an expiration date.
Also I can add, in the big European cities because of the air quality and because the fuel stack needs very clean air, the air filters need to be changed every 8k km. Source: the facebook groups of users testing these cars.
Also, once the fuel stack is started, it cannot be shutdown. If it runs out of hydrogen, you can throw it to the dumpster.
Hydrogen passengers cars are DOA. I don't even know why Toyota is even trying. Probably because they wasted billions of $ already.

In Summary

- The theory behind the 2006 IEEE paper “Does a Hydrogen Economy Make Sense?” is fully borne out in practice
-y real world data
- The concept of a fully off-grid renewables-powered hydrogen filling station is unworkable in the real world – the
-olumes of hydrogen made are pitiful. It is pure greenwash, a smokescreen to enabled the deployment of
-brown’ hydrogen derived from fossil fuels and allow incumbents to retain control of the supply chain
- There is no hydrogen vehicle that can compete with upstream grid CO2 emissions of a BEV – this applies to cars,
-uses and trains. Renewable energy is more effective when sold to the grid in reducing overall emissions
- An investment of billions is needed to build out hydrogen infrastructure. Millions in public funding has already
-een put into sites that can sustainably fill at best a handful of cars per day
- The advocates for hydrogen are often some of the world’s biggest companies, yet they are unwilling to self-fund
-his infrastructure build
- Every Pound, Dollar, Euro or Yen put into funding hydrogen could have been orders of magnitude more effective
at reducing oil dependence and greenhouse g
