People who don't truly understand this statement think that it means to resist charlatans who claim they are enlightened. Crucify the teacher...

Here's the trick: In order to see the Buddha, you have to BE the Buddha. If you aren't the Buddha, you can't really understand the Buddha. Once you understand the Buddha, you can let him go. Not before.

Once you stand nose to nose with the Buddha (you "meet him on the road") then you have no more to learn from the Buddha. At that point, holding on to those teachings becomes a crutch. an identity. No teaching is meant to be held onto. They are meant to provide an experience for where you are at in the moment. Hear the same thing later, and it will provide a new meaning, and a new experience.

Each teaching is a stepping stone to take you to the next level of understanding. Holding onto a teaching keeps you in place. It holds you into an identity.

"Kill the Buddha" doesn't mean the Buddha is bad or wrong. It means you don't need him anymore. In order to be done with him, you must first use him up.

Each teacher can only show you what they know. Once you know that, you will add to it what you know and transcend those teachings. Use the truths AND untruths of teachings to help you find your own truths. Then let go of the teachings. Then kill the Buddha. Not before.

However, Rinza's use of this expression doesn't seem to be about reverence, exactly. In saying "What do you yourselves lack? ... You just don't believe this and keep on seeking outside... Better than grasp at the words from my mouth, take it easy and do nothing" he seems to be talking about a common (even near-universal) tendency to pay more attention to texts than to actual practice. Putting a head on top of your head means seeing the world through someone else's experience rather than using your own experience as a basis for insight.

This would correspond, I believe, to the third fetter of "clinging to moral rules and religious practices" (silabbata-paramasa) as opposed to its antidote, which is "knowledge and vision of what is and is not the path" (maggamagga-nanadassana). In this context placing no head above your own becomes at some point an indispensable practice. We're of course dependent on the teachings of others at first, but increasingly we take those teachings only as a guide to seeing things as they are, and learn to look directly at our own experience. Or, as Gunaratana put it, "...don't just accept somebody else's word. See for yourself."
