- There are many ways for motivated parties to “hack” humans by influencing their media sources and fellow community members. This document collects examples of intentional and unintentional hacks of media. The hope is to unbias these sources and provide antibodies. https://github.com/nemild/hack-the-media

- The availability heuristic is a mental shortcut that relies on immediate examples that come to a given person's mind when evaluating a specific topic, concept, method or decision. The availability heuristic operates on the notion that if something can be recalled, it must be important, or at least more important than alternative solutions which are not as readily recalled. Subsequently, under the availability heuristic, people tend to heavily weigh their judgments toward more recent information, making new opinions biased toward that latest news. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic

## facebook

The rise of social media has provoked both optimism about potential societal benefits andconcern  about  harms  such  as  addiction,  depression,  and  political  polarization.   We  present  arandomized  evaluation  of  the  welfare  effects  of  Facebook,  focusing  on  US  users  in  the  run-up  to  the  2018  midterm  election.   We  measured  the  willingness-to-accept  of  2,743  Facebookusers to deactivate their Facebook accounts for four weeks,  then randomly assigned a subsetto actually do so in a way that we verified.  Using a suite of outcomes from both surveys anddirect measurement, we show that Facebook deactivation (i) reduced online activity, includingother social media, while increasing offline activities such as watching TV alone and socializingwith  family  and  friends;  (ii)  reduced  both  factual  news  knowledge  and  political  polarization;(iii) increased subjective well-being;  and (iv) caused a large persistent reduction in Facebookuse  after  the  experiment.   Deactivation  reduced  post-experiment  valuations  of  Facebook,  butvaluations still imply that Facebook generates substantial consumer surplus.
