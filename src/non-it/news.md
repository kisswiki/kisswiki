- There are many ways for motivated parties to “hack” humans by influencing their media sources and fellow community members. This document collects examples of intentional and unintentional hacks of media. The hope is to unbias these sources and provide antibodies. https://github.com/nemild/hack-the-media

- The availability heuristic is a mental shortcut that relies on immediate examples that come to a given person's mind when evaluating a specific topic, concept, method or decision. The availability heuristic operates on the notion that if something can be recalled, it must be important, or at least more important than alternative solutions which are not as readily recalled. Subsequently, under the availability heuristic, people tend to heavily weigh their judgments toward more recent information, making new opinions biased toward that latest news. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic

## facebook

The rise of social media has provoked both optimism about potential societal benefits andconcern  about  harms  such  as  addiction,  depression,  and  political  polarization.   We  present  arandomized  evaluation  of  the  welfare  effects  of  Facebook,  focusing  on  US  users  in  the  run-up  to  the  2018  midterm  election.   We  measured  the  willingness-to-accept  of  2,743  Facebookusers to deactivate their Facebook accounts for four weeks,  then randomly assigned a subsetto actually do so in a way that we verified.  Using a suite of outcomes from both surveys anddirect measurement, we show that Facebook deactivation (i) reduced online activity, includingother social media, while increasing offline activities such as watching TV alone and socializingwith  family  and  friends;  (ii)  reduced  both  factual  news  knowledge  and  political  polarization;(iii) increased subjective well-being;  and (iv) caused a large persistent reduction in Facebookuse  after  the  experiment.   Deactivation  reduced  post-experiment  valuations  of  Facebook,  butvaluations still imply that Facebook generates substantial consumer surplus.

## tips

The 2 principles of anonu apply here:

1. Moderation in all things

2. The devil is in the details. There's a bit more nuance to the situation.

Your attention is yours. What happens in the media, Facebook, etc... Is an attempt to take your attention. For the most part your allocation is spent where the biggest dopamine hit can come from. If you start valuing your attention based more on an ROI calculation where your return is "did I learn something useful from a balanced source that can help form my world view?" Then you quickly start to cut out the BS.

Here are my tips for high ROI consumption:

Read long form articles about a subject. Skip over them if needed so a as not to waste time.

Call BS early. Poorly written books or articles should be nixed immediately.

Avoid the sugar: low ROI stuff like Instagram, Facebook, Reddit

## Heart of a Dog - Mikhail Bulgakov

There is an amazing book written in 1925: A Heart of a Dog by Mikhail Bulgakov. And there is just as an amazing movie based on it. There is an exchange about not reading soviet newspapers if one cares about digestion.

## Aleister Crowley on news

“To read a newspaper is to refrain from reading something worthwhile. [....] The first discipline of education must therefore be to refuse resolutely to feed the mind with canned chatter.”

― Aleister Crowley

## read previous week's newspapers

“To be completely cured of newspapers, spend a year reading the previous week’s newspapers.”

— Nassim Taleb

## Edward Tufte

Edward Tufte notes that when he used to read the New York Times in the morning, it scrambled his brain with so many different topics that he couldn’t get any real intellectual work done the rest of the day.

## Read books

Avoid the noise because it messes with the signal. Your attention is valuable, so why spend so much time on stuff that will be irrelevant in a few days? Read what stands the test of time. Read from publications that respect and value your time, the ones that add more value than they consume. Read what prompts you to think for yourself. Read fewer articles and more books. Read books that have stood the test of time, those that are still in print after 20 years or so.
