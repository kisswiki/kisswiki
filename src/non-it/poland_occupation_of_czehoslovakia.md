To be fair that land was annexed by Chechoslovakia in 1919 when Poland was fighting with Bolsheviks and had no resources to defend other borders. The treaty in 1920 was signed during the most intense part of the war and Poland was more focused on fighting for their life than negotiating international treaties. So IMO taking it back in 1938 was a fair retaliation.
Both sides behaved very oportunistic in 1919 and 1938
