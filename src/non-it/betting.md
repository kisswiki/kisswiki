I've been trying my luck at tennis betting ( https://matchstat.com/profile/soniman ) and the only strategy that seems to work consistently is finding injured players and betting against them. Good example of an injured player is a player that limps (Andy Murray at Wimbledon this year). The computers don't watch matches so injured players can be overvalued by the models. Also, any British tennis player tends to be overvalued because the books are based in the UK. For instance there is an overweight British player named Marcus Willis that last week was a 1.01 favorite to win at a tournament in Las Vegas; he lost, apparently due to dizziness aka being fat. There are some other patterns that can be exploited but the highest return strategy has to be betting against injured favorites. However, I think that would probably require more tennis watching than I want to do. Maybe I could hire somebody on Mechanical Turk to watch tennis for me and report on players who appear to be injured or take medical time outs.
