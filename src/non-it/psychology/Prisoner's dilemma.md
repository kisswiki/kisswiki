Granted, I think this is more of a case of the prisoners dilemma [0] between lower management and upper management (lower management doesn't want to work on it because it doesn't produce features that make him look good but he also does not want to propose the additional developer for it because then upper management will just tell lower management to do it without the additional developer).
