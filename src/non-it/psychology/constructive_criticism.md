Both of these feeling sometimes masqueraded as “constructive criticism” in certain things I’ve said.

Now I try to be mindful of them and just delete the comments I write where I detect them. I have probably wasted hours writing, rewriting and finally deciding not to publish comments of this kind. I know that I will not be able to avoid them every time but I try to do my best.

When I started focusing on the solutions, I started feeling better. I started seeing what others have tried and found successful in dealing with the issues.
