Morphine is my favorite and the one that worked best for me.  Rather than blocking all access to websites when your time runs out for the day, you get minutes added to your allowance every X minutes and you can even save them up for later if you want (I give myself 3 minutes of time on distracting websites every 10 minutes).

## Procrastination

The basic issue of procrastination is viewed in the article as a formula:

`Motivation = (Expectancy x Value) / (Impulsiveness x Delay)`

Thus, one has four methods of attack for procrastination (increase the two in the numerator, decrease the two in the denominator):

- Increase the expectancy that you will succeed. Many procrastinate because they don't think, they will achieve success as an outcome.
- Increase perceived value. When we don't value the outcome of the task we should do, we will choose other things to do instead.
- Reduce impulsiveness. Making plans, putting things like StayFocused or LeechBlock into place, having accountability confidants, etc., will help.
- Reduce delay. The longer you put off something you should do, the easier it becomes to keep putting it off.

### Increasing Expectancy

- have process or learning goals rather than product or outcome goals. That is, the goals are acquiring or refining new skills or steps (the process) rather than winning or getting the highest score (the product)
- community groups that are great for fostering positivity, watching inspirational movies, reading inspirational biographies, and listening to motivational speakers
- regularly and vividly imagining what you want to achieve and then mentally contrast that with where you are now. This presents your current situation as an obstacle to be overcome to achieve your dreams, and jumpstarts planning and effort.
- too much optimism about how long a task will take may cause you to put it off until the last minute

### Increasing Value

- If the task you're avoiding is boring, try to make it more difficult, right up to the point where the difficulty level matches your current skill, and you achieve "flow."21 This is what the state troopers of Super Troopers did: they devised strange games and challenges to make their boring job passable.
- make sure tasks are connected to something you care about for its own sake,22 at least through a chain: you read the book so you can pass the test so you can get the grade so you can get the job you want and have a fulfilling career. Breaking the chain leaves a task feeling meaningless.


#### Energy

Most people have the most energy during a period starting a few hours after they wake up and lasting 4 hours.25 Also, make sure to get enough sleep and exercise regularly.

Other things that have worked for many people are:

- Drink lots of water.
- Stop eating anything that contains wheat and other grains.
- Use drugs (especially modafinil) as necessary.
- Do short but intense exercise once a week.
- When tired, splash cold water on your face or take a shower or do jumping jacks or go running.
- Listen to music that picks up your mood.
- De-clutter your life, because clutter is cognitively exhausting for your brain to process all day long.

#### Rewards

One obvious way to inject more value into a task is to reward yourself for completing it.27

Also, mix bitter medicine with sweet honey. Pair a long-term interest with a short-term pleasure.28 Find a workout partner whose company you enjoy. Treat yourself to a specialty coffee when doing your taxes. I bribe myself with Pinkberry frozen yogurt to do things I hate doing.
