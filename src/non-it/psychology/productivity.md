Morphine is my favorite and the one that worked best for me.  Rather than blocking all access to websites when your time runs out for the day, you get minutes added to your allowance every X minutes and you can even save them up for later if you want (I give myself 3 minutes of time on distracting websites every 10 minutes).

## Procrastination

The basic issue of procrastination is viewed in the article as a formula:

`Motivation = (Expectancy x Value) / (Impulsiveness x Delay)`

Thus, one has four methods of attack for procrastination (increase the two in the numerator, decrease the two in the denominator):

- Increase the expectancy that you will succeed. Many procrastinate because they don't think, they will achieve success as an outcome.
- Increase perceived value. When we don't value the outcome of the task we should do, we will choose other things to do instead.
- Reduce impulsiveness. Making plans, putting things like StayFocused or LeechBlock into place, having accountability confidants, etc., will help.
- Reduce delay. The longer you put off something you should do, the easier it becomes to keep putting it off.
