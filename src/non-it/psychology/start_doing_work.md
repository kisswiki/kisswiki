## [NeedAdvice] I really can't start doing work

@-Desultor:

So I'm an almost 21 year old computer science student. I was good at school and I was doing okay for most of my university time. There were times where I would get lazy and work dangerously close to a deadline, but everything used to work out in my favor either by pure luck or me pulling myself together.

However, lately my laziness and procrastination have transcended into almost unreal levels. I've got a diploma work to present in about a month, and I haven't done jackshit about it. There are some related papers that I need to write and haven't even started yet, and I'm close to being THREE fucking weeks late on presenting them.

My inner voice or my conscience or whatever is yelling at me almost constantly. The thought that I need to start working a week ago is gnawing at me all the time. The worst thing is, it doesn't seem to do shit except for plunging me deeper into despair. Instead of searching for sources that would help my works, I browse reddit, youtube, or play video games. For some reason, I think "Meh, I'll start doing it in a few minutes. Just let me read this thread for the seventh time real quick" every single time.

I've tried to combat it, but nothing seems to be working. I've tried to develop useful habits like making that 7x7 board where you need to put Xs for each day you've done something - it's hanging on my wall right now, abandoned at day 12 several weeks ago. I've tried to use that Cold Turkey program to forcibly shut everything distracting down - and I still managed to accomplish a whole fucking lot of nothing, while jumping like a hungry dog on reddit once lockdown lifted every time.

I just have no idea what to do anymore and how to fix myself. Every sign tells me that the longer I hold off the work, the harder it's going to bite me in the ass, and my brain seems to be okay with it. I just don't start working no matter what. Please help me pull my miserable ass up.

@drivers9001:

I know exactly how you feel because I've been there. So here's what I suggest. When you think about starting to work, the primitive part of your brain freaks out because of all the things you're saying to yourself. You're thinking about how much you have to do, and berrating yourself. Doing something else brings comfort back and so that part of your brain really controls the decision.

So, what should you do about it? You have to trick yourself. Say things like "I'm just going to get out the folder" (or whatever your first step is). Pick something so ridiculously small that your subconscious won't freak out. If it does, back off and make it smaller.

One way to do something small on a larger piece of work is to do "sprints". For example, do 1 minute of X. Read n emails. Whatever is small enough to not feel like a threat that brings up negative thoughts. Whenever you are working on something and the thought of stopping comes into your mind, stop. You don't want to associate starting something with forcing yourself to keep going. But do keep starting over and over again, with small enough pieces that are not threatening.
What would be your first step anyway, that is laughably small?

@taylynne:

Also - consider finding a place that you know you'll work at. When I had to write essays for classes, or design something for projects, I had to get away from the computer. I still do. I get so distracted, everything takes 50 times longer than it should. If I grab some paper and a pen, and go sit at a "work area" I am much more focused, and I get things done so much faster.
You need to mentally associate a place with "work" and do nothing but work in that place. My personal computer is not a good place for me to work at, because it is where I play games, and waste time. But I can work fine with a computer at college or at the library. If you need a computer for your project, consider spending a lot more time in the library.
