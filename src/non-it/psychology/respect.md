- Treat people with decency, but respect has to be earned. Jordan Peterson to Student: "You can't force me to respect you" https://youtu.be/WDLIR71Pe0A

##

respect

: a feeling of admiring someone or something that is good, valuable, important, etc.

courtesy:

:polite behavior that shows respect for other people


"respect" in this context means:

Do not offer disrespect to someone unless they earn it.


The word "respect" is used differently by different people.

Many people call curtesy "respect", while what you are asking to be earned is called "admiration", not respect.

We have a cultural history of paying respect (curtesy) to people who are either senior by age, rank or experience. Usage of certain words like "Dad, Mom, Grandpa, Grandma, Uncle Aunt, Sir, Ma'am, Miss, Mr. President, Your Excellency" etc. when the situation demands it makes for polite and smooth interactions.

A demand for respect (curtesy) is not a demand for admiration, it is a demand for following a social protocol.
