## Bryan Johnson's sleep 10 habits

1. Reframe Your Identity: You are a professional sleeper

- Make sleep your #1 priority. Nothing influences your conscious existence more.
- Plan your day around sleep. It’s the most important appointment in your calendar.
- Get buy-in and support from others by explaining your priorities.
- Ignore those who say sleep is for the weak. They’re drunk from sleep deprivation.
- Sleep will make you a top performer.

2. Create a 30-60 minute Wind-Down Routine: Set a specific time each evening to start wind down, for example:

- Engage in relaxing activities like reading or taking a warm bath. An online randomized clinical trial on 991 subjects concluded that reading a book in bed improved sleep quality in a majority of participants, as self-reported by the participants using SQS scoring.
- Practice mindfulness or deep breathing exercises. In a wide meta analysis, mindfulness meditation outperformed controls and proved equivalent to medications in treating sleep disturbances.
- Listen to soothing music: Soft, calming music can help signal that it's time to sleep. In a study on 94 students, soothing classical music outperformed a negative control and an audiobook at improving sleep quality and reducing depression. In older adults too, a meta analysis of 9 studies with 489 participants showed significant improvements with sleep latency, duration, and efficiency with various music interventions in multiple settings and countries.

3. Get Morning Light:

- Get outside within the first 15-30 minutes of waking to set your circadian rhythm and boost mood.
- Use a light therapy device if natural sunlight isn’t available.

4. Regulate Evening Light:

- Dim the lights one to two hours before bedtime to create a relaxed atmosphere.
- Use warm lighting in the evening. Even better, use a red light. Plus it’s a cool vibe.
- Install blue light filters on your devices (i.e. f.lux) and consider blue light-blocking glasses.
- Limit screen time at least an hour before bed and blackout your bedroom.

5. Regulate Your Bedroom Temperature:

- Keep your bedroom temperature between 60-67°F (15-19°C).
- Choose breathable bedding and light sleepwear.
- Use fans or cooling devices and consider taking a warm bath before bed.
- Ventilate your room and or use a temperature-controlled mattress if possible.
- Track your sleep patterns with a journal or sleep tracker.

6. Keep a Consistent Bedtime:

- Choose a bedtime that allows for 7-9 hours in bed each night.
- Avoid scheduling late nights and be consistent even on weekends.
- Set an alarm for winding down.
- Track your sleep patterns with a journal or sleep tracker.

7. Curate Your Sleep Environment:

- Ensure your bedroom is quiet, dark, and cool.
- Invest in a comfortable mattress and pillows.
- Remove distractions and keep your bedroom clean and clutter-free.
- Consider using a noise machine to offset environmental sounds or earplugs if necessary.

8. Eat your final meal of the day hours before bed:

- For years I tested my eating times on sleep quality and landed at 11 am being the best for high quality sleep. By the time I go to bed at 8:30 pm, primary digestion is done and my resting heart rate is around 47-49 bpm. If I eat later in the day, my resting heart rate will be between 55-58 bpm because my body is still digesting food and it will lessen my sleep quality by ~30%. But you don’t need to do what I do.
- Try to have your last meal of the day at least two hours before bed and avoid large meals close to bedtime. You can experiment extending to eating your final meal of the day 4 and 6 hours before bed and assess whether it improves your sleep quality. Eating close to bed creates large metabolic demands on your body, causes blood glucose fluctuations, reduces melatonin production, and disrupts your body’s natural process of lowering core body temperature.
- Like me, you may find that certain foods such as pasta and breads reduce the quality of sleep.  I was very surprised to see how much food positively and negatively affected my sleep.

9. Avoid Stimulants Before Bed:

- Try to avoid caffeine, alcohol, and other stimulants at least 10 hours before sleep. I don’t consume caffeine or alcohol. They each disrupt my mood and negatively affect my sleep. But that’s me. You can find what’s right for you.
- Caffeine has a half life of 6 hours in the blood. That means that consuming a cup of coffee 6 hours before bedtime is equivalent to drinking half a cup immediately before going to bed!
- Caffeine manipulates brain cells by blocking their sensing of declining energy levels (blocking adenosine receptors). And this sense of declining energy levels is essential for your brain to switch to sleep mode. Caffeine in your system close to bedtime can also interfere with your sleep phases and quality later in the night.
- You might think that alcohol, as a depressant, helps you sleep faster. That may be true, but alcohol also has a negative effect on your sleep quality. Alcohol reduces REM sleep, increases sleep fragmentation (frequent awakenings), and can exacerbate existing medical conditions
- Opt for herbal teas or other relaxing drinks in the evening.

10. Gather Data:

- Track your sleep habits and patterns with a journal or sleep tracker.
- Use the data to make informed decisions and adjustments to your routine.
- Continuously monitor and tweak your habits to optimize your sleep quality.

to zasługa 5 rzeczy:

- nie jem po osiemnastej, czasami nawet wcześniej, ewentualnie jakiś napój jak zbożowa z mlekiem owsianym lub kakao
- dobrze wywietrzona i chłodna sypialnia
- nie piję kawy
- kobieta co nie pozwala mi po nocach coś robić
- wiedza, że jak regularnie chodzę spać, to wystarczy poleżeć, żeby usnąć, nawet jak chce się na chwilę coś zobaczyć w telefonie

One of my most controversial software opinions is that your sleep quality and stress level matter far, far more than the languages you use or the practices you follow. Nothing else comes close: not type systems, not TDD, not formal methods, not ANYTHING.

By reanalyzing the data, she and her colleagues made two key findings. First, they found that the volunteers’ performance improved primarily during the short rests, and not during typing. The improvements made during the rest periods added up to the overall gains the volunteers made that day. Moreover, these gains were much greater than the ones seen after the volunteers returned the next day to try again, suggesting that the early breaks played as critical a role in learning as the practicing itself.

Second, by looking at the brain waves, Dr. Bönstrup found activity patterns that suggested the volunteers’ brains were consolidating, or solidifying, memories during the rest periods. Specifically, they found that the changes in the size of brain waves, called beta rhythms, correlated with the improvements the volunteers made during the rests.

Further analysis suggested that the changes in beta oscillations primarily happened in the right hemispheres of the volunteers’ brains and along neural networks connecting the frontal and parietal lobes that are known to help control the planning of movements. These changes only happened during the breaks and were the only brain wave patterns that correlated with performance.

“Our results suggest that it may be important to optimize the timing and configuration of rest intervals when implementing rehabilitative treatments in stroke patients or when learning to play the piano in normal volunteers,” said Dr. Cohen. “Whether these results apply to other forms of learning and memory formation remains an open question.”

Dr. Cohen’s team plans to explore, in greater detail, the role of these early resting periods in learning and memory.

Painter Salvador Dali and inventor Thomas Edison both actively worked with it. After a round of focused work, Dali sat on his arm chair to think and doze off. In one hand he held a big key and the moment he fell asleep the key dropped, which woke him up and so he went back to the canvas to continue his focused work. Steve Jobs broke up his daily thinking routine by going out for long walks.

## extreme night owls

Scientists studied 21 "extreme night owls" who were going to bed, on average, at 02:30 and not waking until after 10:00.

Their instructions were to:

- Wake up 2-3 hours earlier than usual and get plenty of outdoor light in the morning
- Eat breakfast as soon as possible
- Exercise only in the morning
- Have lunch at the same time every day and eat nothing after 19:00
- Banish caffeine after 15:00
- Have no naps after 16:00
- Go to bed 2-3 hours earlier than usual and limit light in the evenings
- Maintain the same sleep and wake times every day

After three weeks, people had successfully shifted their body clocks two hours earlier in the day, the analysis by the University of Birmingham, University of Surrey and Monash University showed.

The results, in the journal Sleep Medicine, showed people still got the same hours of shut-eye.

But they reported lower levels of sleepiness, stress and depression, while tests showed their reaction times also improved.
