> Ultimate Yogi kind of assumes one already knows what upward facing dog etc is. Yo:30 offers easier modifications and one of the people on screen demos them, while Ultimate Yogi sometimes mentions modifications briefly, everyone on screen seems to be doing full poses. The Ultimate Yogi is like being in a yoga class with large number of people, whereas yo:30 just shows three people on screen.

## Knee pain

- 5 yoga poses for Knee Pain https://youtu.be/LJ22NekVvS8

> It's unwise to lock the knees in any pose unless told otherwise

> Yes, yoga is known for its healing powers and ability to transform your body and mind into a lean — yet much less mean — you.
> However, it’s also a physical exercise and often a vigorous one. As such, if done incorrectly, it can also cause pain and even major injury. One MD friend told me recently he’s never seen this many muscular and joint issues stemming from yoga. And by “issues,” he means ruptures, pulls, tears, and herniated discs. All of which could — and do — halt yoga practitioners in their tracks every day.

## YogAlign

> years of practicing body positions that do not simulate real life function can lead to misalignment, chronic pain, and even surgical replacements.
> Any back doctor will tell you to always bend your knees when leaning over. Why does yoga get a hall pass to ignore this basic anatomical rule to bend the knees?
> Protect your spine and lower back curves in yoga: Keep your knees deeply bent in all seated and standing forward bends, and stay out of all yoga poses that create a C shape in the spinal column.
> In order for yoga to evolve and be safe for all, we must use critical thinking, discernment, awareness and simple bio-mechanical common sense.
> I always remind my students to practice naturally aligned posture as the most important asana. If an asana does not support your spine in good posture, it is quite possibly working to pull your body out of alignment, and what is the benefit of doing it?
> Three simple tests to determine whether a pose serves the human design:
> 1. It should allow the spine to maintain its natural curves.
> 2. It should not restrict the ability to do deep, rib-cage breathing.
> 3. It should have a real-life correlation to functional joint movement.
