> „Światło Jogi” B.K.S. Iyengara to jedna z najważniejszych książek przeznaczona dla zachodniego czytelnika zainteresowanego Hatha-Jogą.
Jest to podstawowy podręcznik do Hatha - Jogi metodą Iyengara napisany przez twórcę tej metody. Nie ma wątpliwości, że jest to najpopularniejsza i najważniejsza książka napisana przez Iyengara, przez wielu nazywana Biblią Jogi.

> Ultimate Yogi kind of assumes one already knows what upward facing dog etc is. Yo:30 offers easier modifications and one of the people on screen demos them, while Ultimate Yogi sometimes mentions modifications briefly, everyone on screen seems to be doing full poses. The Ultimate Yogi is like being in a yoga class with large number of people, whereas yo:30 just shows three people on screen.

### 01. Crosstraining - Power Yoga - The Ultimate Yogi with Travis Elliot

Robię modyfkacje żeby mnie kolana nie bolały:

1. Nie zginam na łydkach do końca w child pose. Unoszę się bardziej.
2. Uginam kolana przy pochyleniu do przodu.
3. Mam lekko ugiętą nogę przy wojowniku a nie 90 stopni.
4. Przy chair pose staram się, żeby kolana też nie były 90 stopni tylko mniej ugięte. No i żeby kolano niewychodziło do przodu poza stopę.
5. Kwiat lotosu czy takie skręcanie kolana do wewnątrz jak się leży - nie robię tego bo mi źle działa na kolana.

Po tych ćwiczeniach głowa mi przestaje boleć oraz mata jest cała w pocie po 40 minutach albo szybciej. Bo to jest w końcu cardio joga.

> Yes, yoga is known for its healing powers and ability to transform your body and mind into a lean — yet much less mean — you.
> However, it’s also a physical exercise and often a vigorous one. As such, if done incorrectly, it can also cause pain and even major injury. One MD friend told me recently he’s never seen this many muscular and joint issues stemming from yoga. And by “issues,” he means ruptures, pulls, tears, and herniated discs. All of which could — and do — halt yoga practitioners in their tracks every day.

> years of practicing body positions that do not simulate real life function can lead to misalignment, chronic pain, and even surgical replacements.
> Any back doctor will tell you to always bend your knees when leaning over. Why does yoga get a hall pass to ignore this basic anatomical rule to bend the knees?
> Protect your spine and lower back curves in yoga: Keep your knees deeply bent in all seated and standing forward bends, and stay out of all yoga poses that create a C shape in the spinal column.
> In order for yoga to evolve and be safe for all, we must use critical thinking, discernment, awareness and simple bio-mechanical common sense.
> I always remind my students to practice naturally aligned posture as the most important asana. If an asana does not support your spine in good posture, it is quite possibly working to pull your body out of alignment, and what is the benefit of doing it?
> Three simple tests to determine whether a pose serves the human design:
> 1. It should allow the spine to maintain its natural curves.
> 2. It should not restrict the ability to do deep, rib-cage breathing.
> 3. It should have a real-life correlation to functional joint movement.

> purchased this DVD from the Yogalign website. I came upon the Yogalign method after taking yoga classes at a local studio and researching if some of the poses were safe for me to do (fish pose, plow pose, shoulder stand, camel, etc). Something just didn't feel right in my body while practicing those questionable poses and I did some online research which confirmed my suspicions that if you are are not naturally super flexible then contorting yourself into uncomfortable poses might be of no benefit and may cause injury. After about a month of Yogalign practice two or three times a week this yoga method helped to relieve an upper backache I couldn't seem to get rid of. The poses are not difficult nor uncomfortable since they honor the natural curves of the human body. I do feel taller and lighter after the practice. It's a good long practice and there is the option to select segments to practice if you can't do the whole workout. The voice over instructions are clear and the beach setting is beautiful along with some funny characters in the background!. As a woman about to celebrate her 50th birthday I plan to continue Yogalign to improve my posture and stay flexible.

> I read through her website in the week before she came to the studio, and noticed that she uses William Broad's notorious book, The Science of Yoga, as an example of how "dangerous" yoga is.
> I've learned that a huge part of asana is meant to bring your awareness into your own body. How many years have we all spent rushing through life in this body without giving any thought to how it feels or what it wants? It's probably the hardest part of asana practice for many of us: learning how to tune in to our bodies and what they really want after all these years, and learning how to treat ourselves gently. That doesn't necessarily make the practice of asana dangerous - it just means that we have to pay attention to how and what we're practicing.
> too much flexibility without strength can be a liability in asana practice
> for now, I'm going to continue to practice certain asanas with the support of props like blankets and modifications like bent knees

> When you overstretch ligaments, there’s a good chance they will not bounce back to their former length.
> If ligaments are meant to protect joints by limiting their movement, continually overstretching joints can lead to joint instability over time. I know a number of serious practitioners who are now in their 50s—including myself—who regret having overstretched our joints back in the day. All too many longtime practitioners now own artificial joints to replace the ones they overused.

> Like any exercise, though, yoga can have risks. People with herniated disks or osteoporosis, for example, should avoid deep forward bends, and anyone with neck problems http://www.livescience.com/18059-yoga-safe-tips-avoid-injuries.html should steer clear of headstands, Loren Fishman, a New York City physician who is also a yoga instructor, told LiveScience in 2012. Talking to a doctor about specific issues before starting a practice is recommended, as is letting your yoga teacher know of any limitations.

> Those with osteoporosis could fracture their spines by bending forward, and those with herniated disks may suffer pain from these stretches, said Dr. Loren Fishman, a New York City physician who is also a yoga instructor.
> Fishman recommends that those with MS do Iyengar yoga instead, as it focuses on alignment and is gentler on the body.

Benoy Matthews, a leading UK-based physiotherapist, warns he is seeing increasing numbers of yoga teachers with serious hip problems - many of whom require surgery - because they are pushing their bodies too hard.

"People confuse stiffness and pain," he says. "If there is a pinching or blocking feeling in the groin, it shouldn't be ignored. You have to know your limits."

<br>

But according to Dr Rajgopal, the extreme stretching exercises at the heart of the discipline cause severe stress on joints, leading to arthritis.

He has seen a higher incidence of joint and bone ailments among yoga followers.

"Yoga is wonderful provided it is done in a controlled environment, and people are trained and built up to doing such postures but putting the public at large through these extreme yoga postures can create problems for them," he said.

"Many yoga gurus had to undergo knee surgeries, they had been affected by yoga postures," he told The Daily Telegraph.

Ashok Rajgopal is an Indian orthopaedic surgeon, credited with close to 20,000 Arthroscopic and over 35,000 Total Knee Arthroplasty surgeries[1] and reported to be one of the most experienced in his field in India.[1] He was honoured by the Government of India in 2014, by bestowing on him the Padmashri, the fourth highest civilian award, for his services to the fields of orthopaedic surgery.

<br>

Results: The final sample included 354 participants from two suburban yoga studios. The incidence rate of pain caused by yoga was 10.7%. More than one-third of incident cases resulted in lost yoga participation time and/or symptoms lasting more than 3 months. None of the risk factors at baseline increased the risk for subsequent incident cases of pain caused by yoga.

Conclusions: Yoga can cause musculoskeletal pain. Participants may benefit from disclosure of practice to their healthcare professionals and by informing teachers of injuries they may have prior to participation. Yoga teachers should also discuss the risks for injury with their students.
