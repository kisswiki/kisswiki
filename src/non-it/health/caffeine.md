## Elon Musk

Elon Musk the caffeine addict

The Tesla founder recently copped to working 120 hours a week, leaving little room for shuteye. To compensate for this sleep deprivation, Musk used to drink large amounts of caffeinated beverages.

"There were probably times when I had like eight [diet cokes] a day or something ridiculous," Musk told the German automobile magazine Auto Bild in 2014. "I think these days it's probably one or two, so it's not too crazy."

He also struggled with a coffee addiction. "I used to have so much coffee...that I'd get really wired," said Musk. "I'd get over-caffeinated and it wouldn't be good."

Health experts say that consuming too much caffeine can increase [anxiety](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25471197) and stress levels and creates a [toxic cycle](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28603504) of fatigue, which leads to increased coffee consumption, which impairs your sleep, which leads to more [fatigue the next day](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3280075/), which leads to more caffeine consumption.

Instead, take a page from Musk and swap out a daily coffee for some good ol' H2O. If you can't quit cold-turkey, slowly decrease the amount of caffeinated beverages you consume each day.
