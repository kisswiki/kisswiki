"Eyestrain can occur when the eyes are fixed on an object for a long period of time, there is poor lighting, or there is glare," explains John Bullough, Ph.D., lighting scientist at the LRC and lead researcher on the television study. "One scenario believed to cause eyestrain is watching television in a dark room. In this case, visual discomfort is caused by the large difference in luminance between the television screen and the room's dark background."

CNN reports that eye strain indeed can occur from prolonged use of a computer or TV watching, but also goes on to say that the Mayo Clinic finds there are no long-term side effects or consequences.

"The human eye does not function to its best advantage in the dark or in looking at a fairly well illuminated object when the eye itself is surrounded by darkness," according to Mr. Henry. "There should prevail as high a degree of general illumination as may be consistent with securing clear and easy vision of the picture.

"Too low illumination causes dilation of the pupil to an abnormal degree and provides a coreal area which does not permit of focal accuracy and which tends to distortion of outline. To partially overcome this, segmental action of the ciliary muscle governing the focusing of the eye is induced. Such muscular action can only be attained by great effort.

"There is also strain of the iris muscles resulting from the prolonged dilation of the pupil and another objection is that the varying intensity of the light reflected from the screen requires constant iris action more difficult of accomplishment than under normal dilation.

For instance, a positive polarity advantage has been found in error rates and reading speed in a letter identification task (Bauer and Cavonius 1980), the number of transcribed letters onto paper (Radl 1980), subjective ratings on visual comfort (Saito, Taptagaporn, and Salvendy 1993; Taptagaporn and Saito 1990, 1993), text comprehension (A. H. Wang, Fang, and Chen 2003), reading speed (Chan and Lee 2005) and proofreading performance (Buchner and Baumgartner 2007). Taptagaporn and Saito (1990, 1993) tracked changes in pupil size for different illumination levels as well as for the viewing of different visual targets, such as a cathode ray tube (CRT) display, script and keyboard. They found less visual fatigue as measured by the frequency of changes in pupil size when working was accomplished with a positive than with a negative polarity display. Likewise, Saito, Taptagaporn, and Salvendy (1993) found faster lens accommodation and thus faster focusing of the eye with positive than with negative polarity displays.

I was a big believer in dark mode for a long time, until I started trying to reduce my SAD symptoms during the winter time. I read this blog post here [0] after seeing it on HN, and ended up buying 28 100W equivalent bulbs and a 500W equivalent corn bulb. I get a pretty decent amount of light in my home office now, and light mode is essential on my workstation or it's almost impossible to even SEE anything on screen, since the external light will wash out the backlights of the LED. I bought some higher brightness monitors but am starting to realize all those years of using dark mode was just lending itself to me spending 8 hours a day working in a dark room and was making me depressed, especially in the winter.
It's been interesting because my wife is complaining about feeling glum but I've been in a much better mood than I've been in the last few winters. We're talking about spending a few thousand dollars to get ultra bright lighting throughout the house instead of just in my office.

It's always been strange to me how many people without a medical reason for doing so want to sit in dark rooms like cave trolls, but there we are.

At least now operating systems all have switchable modes that get reported to the browser. The browser can/should adapt to whatever setting the OS reports.

But UI design is, with a few islands of rationality in history from people like Paul Fitts, mostly a cascade of poorly applied vibes and fads. First people say that contrast is bad, so then people don't use enough contrast. Then people say that brightness is bad, so people don't use enough brightness. Then people realize why contrast and brightness were important all along and the circle of life continues.
