## Compression socks

Compression Socks, Stockings or Hose: You’ll read warnings that standing all day may result in varicose veins or spider veins. Well, sitting on your expanding rear can do the same and worse. Don’t let these naysayers scare you. They’re getting cancer or diabetes. Varicose veins are often genetic and can be exacerbated by pregnancy or various activities or lack thereof. Help prevent their onset/worsening by investing in several pairs of compression socks or compression hose.* See compression socks infographic.

> Ergonomically designed socks have a gradient compression to help drive blood back from feet to heart and achieve the goal of reducing swollen legs and promoting blood flow.

Frequent flyers, nurses, doctors, or people on their feet most of the day are good candidates. Your veins are a compression valve system – they work against gravity to return blood from your legs to your heart. Many athletes wear compression socks for improved physical performance. I wear them most days and have not seen any vein issues after 16 straight months of standing at least seven hours a day, five days a week. I am also relatively young and very healthy, but trust me on the compression socks if you are concerned about veins. They have other benefits and are great to wear during a workout or a long drive or flight.

No one has to know you’re wearing them. I ordered a couple pairs to see which brands I liked then bought extras of my favorites. It was difficult to find articles with  specific product recs and I was confused about the size to buy and the levels of compression (how many mmHg you need). Here are some mild compression knee-highs – these first four are office or casual style:

1. Fytto Style 1020 Women’s Comfy Compression Socks, 15-20mmHg, Knee High ($24.99 or $11.70 with Amazon Prime)
2. Pintoli Style 1007 Women’s Ultra Sheer Moderate Compression Socks, 15-20mmHg, Knee High ($24.99 or from $11.70 with Prime)
3. Dr. Scholl’s Women’s Sheer Therapeutic Graduated Compression Sock, Knee High, 20-30Mmhg ($19-29 or $13-$19 with Prime)
4. Nabee Socks – $29.99. Founded with a Kickstarter campaign by nurse Brian Park. Rooted in science and graduated compression therapy. Fun designs for men and women. Read Nurse Anna’s review. 100% money-back guarantee, great startup company.

Athletic style:

1. Vitalsox Ladies Graduated Compression Socks, Black, Medium ($19.99-$35.00 as of 10/26/16) – there are many nurses with positive reviews of this sock
2. Not a sock – a calf sleeve instead: I bought these then sent my mom pair. They’re great for running, too. Wear them to prevent varicose veins and help circulation on long flights, while sitting at work, or at your standing desk: CEP Women’s Progressive+ 2.0 Calf Sleeves

Green STAND upward arrow keyAgain, worth the investment, just like the floor mat. You may want a higher mmHg if you already have vein problems. Seek medical advice if you want over 20mmHg. Care: Handwash or machine wash on the delicate cycle or you will destroy the compressing properties. Line dry.

## Pillows under feet

Use pillows to raise your feet up to the level of your heart. Place pillows underneath your feet and ankles to elevate them. Stack as many as necessary to elevate your feet to the level of your heart. Raising your feet to heart level will help drain pooled blood from your feet and make it easier for your heart to increase circulation.[4]

You may be most comfortable putting a pillow or two underneath your calves as well to support your elevated feet.

2 to 3 hours a day

 Wear support stockings. Wear full-length support stockings to increase blood flow and ease swelling in your feet. Stockings are most effective if you wear them all day, particularly if you’re going to be standing a lot. Avoid compression socks, which may squeeze above the ankle and encourage foot swelling.[11]

Lay down and move feet up - 30 mins 4 to 5 days a week

## Żylaki

Niekorzystne jest przebywanie przez dłuższy czas w pozycji siedzącej, zakładanie nogi na nogę, gdyż takie ułożenie utrudnia dopływ krwi[2]. Dlatego warto podczas siedzenia często poruszać nogami lub od czasu do czasu wstać i pospacerować. W pozycji pionowej zaleca się ćwiczenia wspinania na palce i opadania na pięty. Dzięki takiemu ćwiczeniu mięśnie łydek 'sprawniej' pompują krew żylną z kończyn dolnych do serca.

W zapobieganiu powstawania żylaków istotna jest również garderoba. Im mniej obcisłe części garderoby, tym lepiej. Należy unikać obcisłych spodni, skarpet z gumką lub wysokich butów z obcisłą cholewką. Nie jest zalecana wysoka temperatura; korzystanie z goracych kąpieli, sauny. Każda kąpiel powinna kończyć się chłodnym prysznicem.

W profilaktyce ważna jest również odpowiednia dieta. Unikanie spożywania soli. Nadwaga to dodatkowe obciążenie dla naszych nóg. Zbyt wysokie dawki hormonów serwowane np. w tabletkach antykoncepcyjnych stanowią również realne zagrożenie.
