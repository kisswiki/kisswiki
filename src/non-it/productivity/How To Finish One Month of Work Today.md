1. Tie your outcome to a clear goal.
2. Pre-set the target and schedule it beforehand.
3. Clear the load using active recovery. (Go to bed deaf, blind, cold, hungry for 7-9 hours)
4. Do decision-making tasks the day before(clothes, food, etc.)
5. Wrap up all lose ends the day before. Texts, emails, calls, meetings, etc.
6. Organize your workspace beforehand.
7. Pause all life maintenance load - cooking, cleaning, laundry etc - outsource or do beforehand or save for later. Tell all your relatives you are disappearing for the day.
8. Turn off distractions - phone, use app blockers on PC.
9. Make self-distraction impossible. No distracting thoughts. If they come, note them down and forget them for the time.
10. Stack flow-blocks together.
11. Wake up in flow and dive into highest priority task right away. No morning routine.
12. Treat each flow block as an event, like a battle. It should have a trigger - like closing the door, wearing an earphone, sipping a coffee, after which you attack.
13. Cement the commitment. Don't let its specialness erode. It should be different from every other day in your life. Make it holy and sacrosanct. Keep a higher consequence environment. Use rewards.
14. Have an hour by hour schedule. Have enough long breaks. But do nothing else during the breaks. Just relax.
15. First three hours work. Then one hour non-stimulating recovery. Meditate, yoga, shower, no food here except sugarless coffee.
16. 3 more hours of flow followed by another 1hr recovery. Nap, walk, stretching, very light food
17. 2 more hours of flow followed by 2 hours of active recovery. Workout, big nap, massage, etc.
18. Then 3 more hours of flow. Reward yourself.
