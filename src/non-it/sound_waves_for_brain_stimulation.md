## brain.fm and enhances slow-wave sleep - linked to cognitive performance,  memory, metabolism and mood

You might try the nap category, under sleep. It's 40 minutes but I'll be adding time options too.

But as weird as it sounds, it's best to listen to the sleep sessions all night long, if possible. I can only do it with "Sleep phones" so that may be something you'd want to invest in, if better sleep is a goal for you. Earbuds are too uncomfortable.

Check out the sleep study we did: https://www.brain.fm/pdfs/viewer/web/viewer.html?file=%2Fpdfs%2FEEGSleepAnalysis.pdf

I know it's kind of hard to interpret right now haha, but we'll be adding simpler explanations soon. Basically, it enhances what is called slow-wave sleep, which declines as we age. It's linked to cognitive performance and especially memory! But also linked to things like metabolism and mood. Northwestern recently got a half-million grant to study slow-wave enhancement on metabolism - they already did one on memory, and it was stunning: seniors performed like 20-somethings on memory tests, and 20-somethings performed well beyond their original capabilities. (to be clear those two studies were/are led by Giovanni, our lead neuroscientist, but did not involve Brain.fm directly)

Anyway, the really cool thing to notice about that sleep analysis is at the bottom. It appears to enhance spindles! Spindles have a very established relationship to memory consolidation. That was an unexpected but welcome result.

So in short, there's clear evidence of sleep enhancement, some promising evidence of enhanced memory consolidation, and with further research perhaps even more benefits. Sleep is something I'm very passionate about because poor sleep is an epidemic, and I'm a life long severe insomniac.

Regarding focus, we'll be releasing a study on that in the next few days hopefully. Very good results, both with EEG correlates and cognitive testing. So excited to talk about that, but will keep my mouth shut until it's released.

The tingling feelings you're getting, those are much more mysterious. There are some theories - related to the kind of "skin orgasms" you can have while listening to music you like. There's actually some really interesting "rules" you can use in music to help produce these sensations - rules I've integrated into the music-generating algorithms. But it's going to take a lot more research to confirm why the focus sessions in particular are creating these sensations significantly more than the others. I have some theories... But what I can tell you is why you get them with some tracks and not with others. Brain.fm tries to cycle the intensity of the focus tracks, and for good reason. Intensity means many things - wave depth of the modulations for example, but also the subjective "strength" of the music, and how many cool little augmentations are put in to make it better. We've done a lot of testing on this, and continual high intensities can degrade performance. Increase it at first, but your mind kind of gets.. fatigued if it goes on too long. One of our first tests of this was with Ruth Olmstead, who conducted a study using some very high intensity sessions we made together. The higher the better right? Wrong. All subjects either experienced no benefit or an actual decrease. There's a balance you have to reach. To be clear, all the focus sessions contain significant stimulation, but the cycling that it does is important too.
