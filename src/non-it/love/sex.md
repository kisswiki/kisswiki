The researchers from Hamburg-Eppendorf University Hospital interviewed 530 men and women about their relationships.

They found 60% of 30-year-old women wanted sex "often" at the beginning of a relationship, but within four years of the relationship this figure fell to under 50%, and after 20 years it dropped to about 20%.

In contrast, they found the proportion of men wanting regular sex remained at between 60-80%, regardless of how long they had been in a relationship.

ale nie znaczy, że kochają tych z którymi sie zwiążą nie wybrzydzając. na forach można zaobserwować tendencje do tworzenia tematów o bólu głowy także kobiet po 30, a już szczególnie po urodzeniu dziecka (nieważne czy minął okres połogu). kobieta może użyć mężczyzny tylko po to, by osiągnęła sukces reprodukcyjny = urodzenie dziecka. i tylko dlatego związała się, czy uruchomiła seks. cel osiągnęła, więc nie ma potrzeby, a swojego mężczyzny nigdy tak naprawdę nie kochała, więc i seks zanika.

po prostu w późniejszym wieku znika coś takiego jak friendzone (starszej kobiecie nie przystoi mieć orbitera), więc do czasu ten seks jest, ale tylko po to, by zmusić mężczyzne do zaangażowania, do przekazania zasobów, do zrobienia dziecka, do zaplanowania ślubu (zapewnienie bezpieczeństwa). ukartować zakochanie, by później mieć spokój. faceci są ogólnie ślepi nie mając doświadczenia, więc myślą że jak kobieta jest chętna, namiętna to zakochana. a niestety tak jest, że kobiety oddzielają seks od uczuć, więc nie jest to żaden wyznacznik, a mit z lat 90 bodaj.

Among participants (age = 18–89 years), 15.2% of males and 26.7% of females reported past-year sexlessness while 8.7% of males and 17.5% of females reported no sex for 5 years or more. For both genders, past-year sexlessness was most strongly associated with older age and being currently non-married in the multivariable models. Among males, the multivariable analysis also showed that sexlessness was **associated with providing less than 20% of the household income** (OR 2.27). In female participants, sexlessness was associated with very low income, poor health, lower financial satisfaction, absence of children, and having conservative sexual attitudes (OR 1.46–3.60). For both genders, Black race was associated with a much lower likelihood of sexlessness among currently non-married adults. The purported detrimental impact of sexlessness on self-reported happiness levels was not evident in this large, nationally representative study after adjusting for sociodemographic factors. **Sexless Americans reported very similar happiness levels as their sexually active counterparts**.

Sexual desire is often present at the beginning of a romantic relationship. However, research is divided regarding whether, and how, desire is experienced as a relationship progresses. The authors examined relationship duration and its effect on sexual desire in a sample of 170 undergraduate men and women between the ages of 18 and 25 years. Hierarchical multiple regression results indicated that women’s sexual desire was **significantly and negatively predicted by relationship duration** after controlling for age, relationship satisfaction, and sexual satisfaction. Men’s sexual desire, however, was not significantly affected by the duration of their romantic relationships. These findings suggest that men and women may have different experiences with sexual desire as relationships progress and that sexual desire might be affected by different factors depending on one’s gender. Possible reasons for these results are suggested and therapeutic implications are discussed.

The most frequent conflict within human mateships is the conflict between male sexual
persistence and female sexual resistance. This conflict is nearly absent in the formation
phase of a mateship and intensifies with time. It is rooted in sex-specific evolved
programs encountering each other: a female program to secure male assistance and
simultaneously remain open to new matings and a male program to guard paternity and
to seek frequent copulation as a precaution against sperm competition. Mate value, the
threat of infidelity, and attachment moderate the conflict. Attachment motivation can be
seen as a part of mating strategy or as a motivational system of its own, conflicting with
demands of strategic flexibility. The theoretical framework of mating strategy
accommodates many observations about sexual motivation within human mateships.
However, sexual therapy has not yet taken much advantage of this body of knowledge.
This might result from the different traditions of the respective scientific communities. It
may also reflect a more substantial role of attachment than of mating strategy for the
sexual life of a couple, since sexual therapy often focuses on issues of attachment.

Women with many sex partners as compared with women with fewer sex partners reported their first sexual experience five years earlier, had a lower waist-to-hip ratio, behaved more like boys during childhood, were rated to be more masculine in their physical appearance and their behavior, and were more unrestricted in SO. There was no indication that women who had more sex partners were lower in mate value or endured greater childhood stress than women with fewer sex partners.

Men rated by women as sexually attractive possess and display resources and the prospect of paternal support. Characteristic features are: large size, large shoulder-to-hip ratio, masculine face and voice, vigorous physical movement, intelligence, self-confidence, and pheromones indicating MHC compatibility (see Buss, 1995).

Women who rated their partners as lower in sexual attractiveness reported more expressed love and attention from their partners than women who rated their partners as higher in sexual attractiveness (Pillsworth & Haselton, 2006). This suggests that male loving care and attention may function as a means to compensate for lower sexual attractiveness, and because of this nexus it may not be correlated as strongly with sexual desire of the female partner as is often expected. In a study of German students, female sexual motivation was stronger when male commitment as perceived by the female partner was lower than her own  commitment at every stage of the relationship (Klusmann, 2002).

Is Female Sexual Reluctance Related to Ovulatory Status?

However, this hypothesis has a problem from the start: Why are so many women reluctant
to have sex with their primary partner, sometimes at considerable cost, if it would be so
easy to give in during the infertile phase and restrict reluctance to the fertile phase? This
would suffice to keep a window open for good genes conception and at the same time
avoid the primary partner’s malcontent.

In a large survey of British citizens
(Johnson et al., 1994), the median copulation rate in married couples is reported to be
seven copulations in past month for the age group 16–24 years, decreasing to five
copulations for age group 35–44 years.
