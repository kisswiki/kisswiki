Anger is our emotional mechanism to tap into strength and endurance reserves, while simultaneously suppressing pain. It is adaptive when you're fighting for the life of yourself or a loved one. It causes tunnel-vision, and it is not really a healthy state in general though, so it is definitely maladaptive if you aren't about to engage in some sort of physical conflict. You can recognize something is wrong, and be motivated to do something about it without getting angry, and generally things turn out better if you can avoid anger.

Acting annoyed can get you to a local maximum of helpfulness from others, but it will never get you very close to the global maximum. Moving toward the global maximum requires you to be sensitive to other people's state of mind and being angry dulls this sensitivity. Being annoyed might be a useful tool to have in your toolbox, but don't fool yourself into thinking you can't do better.
Your model of what motivates people is only valid for situations where people feel low levels of connectedness to the person they're dealing with. Essentially, you're missing an important dimension, along which you need to travel to get to the global maximum of helpfulness.
