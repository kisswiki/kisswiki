Anger is our emotional mechanism to tap into strength and endurance reserves, while simultaneously suppressing pain. It is adaptive when you're fighting for the life of yourself or a loved one. It causes tunnel-vision, and it is not really a healthy state in general though, so it is definitely maladaptive if you aren't about to engage in some sort of physical conflict. You can recognize something is wrong, and be motivated to do something about it without getting angry, and generally things turn out better if you can avoid anger.
