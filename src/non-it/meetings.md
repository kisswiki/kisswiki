Elon Musk about meetings:
– Excessive meetings are the blight of big companies and almost always get worse over time. Please get of all large meetings, unless you’re certain they are providing value to the whole audience, in which case keep them very short.
– Also get rid of frequent meetings, unless you are dealing with an extremely urgent matter. Meeting frequency should drop rapidly once the urgent matter is resolved.
– Walk out of a meeting or drop off a call as soon as it is obvious you aren’t adding value. It is not rude to leave, it is rude to make someone stay and waste their time.

Sounds like a minefield honestly.
Being lower in the hierarchy but making decisions whether a meeting is worth your time pushes a ton of risk onto you if there is a mishap.

How do you respond to "You would have known if you stayed at the meeting"? Would the CEO have your back? How many times before you start getting a "problem employee" reputation.

I think you'd quickly realize to just stay at meetings but now you have no grounds to bring up criticism since it is assumed you could just walk out.

>You would have known if you stayed at the meeting
If a meeting is structured such that an attendee has enough time to realize it's pointless and leave before the meeting gets around to the important part, then it's a bad meeting. That meeting sounds like it should have been an email, or a message in an IM channel, or even more than one smaller meetings.

A manager who structures meetings so that people have to sit through pointless drivel in order to receive one or two important nuggets of information, is a bad manager who's scheduling exactly the kind of bad meetings that Musk is talking about.
