the problem is not pleasures. the problem is that pleasure experienced without prior requirement for pursuit yes is terrible for us as individuals.

it's terrible for us as as groups and i have great confidence in the human species to work this out but we are finding now and we are going to increasingly find that those who will be successful young or old are going to be those people who can create their own internal buffers.

they're going to be able to control their relationship to pleasures, because the proximity to pleasures and their availability is the problem.

if you look at problem the increase in use of drugs of abuse or prescription medication which at least at the first pass deliver pleasure, pain relief, the whole issue with the opioid crisis and dopaminergic drugs like ritalin, adderall, you know there is sometimes there's a clinical need but tons of people are clinical need but tons of people are taking those recreationally now or to study huge dopamine increases are what those cause.

that is a problem that's a serious problem, because it creates a cycle where you you need more of that specific thing

i always say addiction is a progressive narrowing of the things that bring you pleasure
