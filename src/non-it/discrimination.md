Think about it. In tech you have to work long hours, usually alone, locked in an office, the work never gets easy as you get older and you will always be framed as a "technical person", which means, can't get a grip in real life.
Probably women are smarter and don't get carried away for nothing, like men.


Women don't need to have a large example of open source online to be taken seriously. Since companies are desperate to hire women in order to avoid the sexism accusations, why would women need a catalogue of work that they've done for free?


Writing code is fun, but it's hard too: long learning curve, complex concepts to adopt, solving software problems is not easy as it may look from outside. There are much quicker ways to progress with your carer then writing code.

Does not appeal to woman's nature

Being a good developer means certain level of autism and focus on the narrow problems solving. Woman's nature is being social and communicable (remember these 14K words a day a woman needs to say) that is quite opposite to a coder. The communicative nature of a woman can explain a high number of CS female students that go to BA related areas after graduation rather than into coding.

There is no requirement to hire a specific number of ethnic minorities, women, people over age 50, or differently abled individuals, however, there are civil rights laws in place to punish employers from declining to hire members of those groups solely because of race or gender or physical characteristics.    To avoid expensive audits from the EEOC, US corporations typically try to hire a workforce that looks like their area; if the general population in town is 30% African American, then showing that your staff is 29% African American is a good way to shrink the time EEOC spends with your HR team, and a defense against lawsuits.

If a large employer cannot  find qualified candidates in various races, genders, etc, they document efforts to try, to help fend off lengthy audits and lawsuits. This was the case in the 1990s when few African Americans were entering accounting firms. The large firms would document the number of people of color graduating with that major, proving it was hard to find candidates meeting their requirements,  as well as documenting their scholarships donated to attract people of color to the field.

If there is a justifiable reason to discriminate, employers have been successful in defending their practices.  An example would be Hooters Restaurant hiring only young women for servers.
