Think about it. In tech you have to work long hours, usually alone, locked in an office, the work never gets easy as you get older and you will always be framed as a "technical person", which means, can't get a grip in real life.
Probably women are smarter and don't get carried away for nothing, like men.


Women don't need to have a large example of open source online to be taken seriously. Since companies are desperate to hire women in order to avoid the sexism accusations, why would women need a catalogue of work that they've done for free?


Writing code is fun, but it's hard too: long learning curve, complex concepts to adopt, solving software problems is not easy as it may look from outside. There are much quicker ways to progress with your carer then writing code.

Does not appeal to woman's nature

Being a good developer means certain level of autism and focus on the narrow problems solving. Woman's nature is being social and communicable (remember these 14K words a day a woman needs to say) that is quite opposite to a coder. The communicative nature of a woman can explain a high number of CS female students that go to BA related areas after graduation rather than into coding.
