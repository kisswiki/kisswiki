Think about it. In tech you have to work long hours, usually alone, locked in an office, the work never gets easy as you get older and you will always be framed as a "technical person", which means, can't get a grip in real life.
Probably women are smarter and don't get carried away for nothing, like men.

Women don't need to have a large example of open source online to be taken seriously. Since companies are desperate to hire women in order to avoid the sexism accusations, why would women need a catalogue of work that they've done for free?
