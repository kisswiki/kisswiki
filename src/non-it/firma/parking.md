The side mirrors are at a 45Â° angle. Use them as reference.

- So, asses of the car together.
- Turn in, until you see BOTH headlights of the car behind you in the opposing side mirror. (even if the space is short or you have a multiple spaces, it will position the car to go exactly where you want it to go in front of the car which headlights you are using as reference in the side mirror)
- Then straighten your wheels and drive backwards until your B-pilar (back of the front side window) is at the same level of the ass of the car in front.
- Now, turn your wheel towards the direction of the side mirror you used to start with while you keep driving back to pull the front of your car towards the curb

If you misjudge the distance or feel comfortable, get more space driving out straight. Don't turn the wheel to confuse yourself
