## procrastination

10 Scientific solutions for overcoming procrastination

1. Address the perceived anxiety about the completion of a task. You know it’s there but it might not be in awareness. So you might have to dig and address your feelings first.
2. It might help if you can bring the avoided/procrastinated task closer to you and distance the aversion activities you are habituated with.
3. Before sleeping, relaxing (via stretching, yoga, breathing exercise, meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, etc.) can help your brain reboot.

## first things first

I’ve found both of these practices really helpful in my own life, but, to be honest, my weekly planning tends to be somewhat sporadic, and I don’t typically think of the decision matrix on a day-to-day basis.

So, while the practices are certainly useful, I don’t think the great majority of people will even try them, much less stick with them. They’re a little involved, and basic human nature being what it is, they’re hard to permanently incorporate into your life.

Therefore, I instead want to strip things back to the very basics, and suggest an approach to living this habit that’s both crazy accessible and crazy effective.

I’m going to do that by treating the maxim of “first things first” quite literally.


the very first thing I do when I get out of bed each day is to engage in a set of mental and spiritual exercises: I pray, read my scriptures, **meditate**, and do an exercise from the [Foundations of Well-Being](https://www.thefoundationsofwellbeing.com/), which I’ve found helps mitigate my tendency towards depression and irritable moodiness.

## hypnagogic nap

To accomplish this micro nap, Dali would sit in a chair with his arms resting on the armrests and his wrists dangling over them. He held a heavy metal key between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand, and placed an upside-down plate on the floor directly below the key. The instant Dali dozed off, the key would slip through his fingers, clang the plate, and awaken him from his nascent slumber. In that moment, Dali observed, one walked “in equilibrium on the taut and invisible wire that separates sleep from waking.” The artist recommended this practice to anyone who worked with their mind, believing that the tiny nap “revivified” one’s whole “physical and physic being” and left you invigorated and inspired for an afternoon of creative labor.

Dali said that he had learned the “slumber with a key” trick from the Capuchin monks and that other artists he knew also used it.

By so doing, they could purposefully wake themselves up right before crossing the threshold into Stage 2 sleep, and immediately write down the insights that had arisen during their brief slumber. They found that these “hypnagogic naps” boosted their creativity and opened their minds to new insights and solutions to problems.

Having fun: smart edition

Humans have an expiration date. You have to admit this. The clock is ticking and every second goes into the past leaving your cycle with one less step to be executed. The thread will inevitably be dead sooner or later(unless you believe into zombies or recurring threads but this is a different story). It is not guaranteed that it will execute its purpose and you never know when the scheduler goes awry and wipes you out. But… You have something. You have now. If you are reading this, you are a living and (I hope) thinking creature. A creature that has some time left.

Our life consists of many parts - we sleep for about 8 hours a day, we work for about the time 5 days a week, we lie around questioning our existence for another hour before or after work depending on our circadian rhythm. Also, we amend our Vim config for a substantial amount of time. We do a lot of stuff that may be worth a couple of other posts. But now I want to speak about the thing you certainly do no matter how old you are. where you are from or what is your puppy middle name(do they have those? they have passports, gosh). I want to speak about the entertainment.

Entertainment enterprise explained by escapists

It is a lovely nice thing we do to escape the dystopian reality we live in that comes closer to the cyberpunk dreams of Philip K. Dick or goddamn Gibson each time Apple/Samsung/Google launches something and ships to a third-world(I mean developing, of course, don’t blame me, I live in one) country. Low live, high tech, you know. Where was I? Oh yeah, entertainment. Mostly, nowadays, this activity involves some kind of screen. It may be a screen of your phone, your 4K TV set, E-Book, laptop, public cinema theatre, you name it. Some of us do sports, drugs or other activities, but in the digital era, digital fun is the most popular one.

You work, you study to get better for work, you optimize your time and get better with what you do. But entertainment is the different thing - there is no need to optimize this - you are just having fun, this area historically does not involve any kind of consideration, planning or analysis, it is a place out of work, so you do the thing that feels better. Right? Wrong. Your life is a whole, why put limits on which approaches should come where? Try to use your serious mind and approach your fun with it. What do you do for fun? You play video games, watch cool stuff on Netflix and YouTube, read 9gag and Twitter, traverse Facebook feed and Reddit. What does it bring to you? A bunch of useless information about the people you don’t care about, life-changing experiences that did not happen to you but the magic of video and plot design does let you feel that you are living through that, aggression throwaway by killing other people online and a few memes.

Junk life is no life

Let’s bring in the analogy. There is healthy food and junk food - first is delicious mostly if you are used to it and get a whip of the diet, the second is created to be tasty enough for you to want to eat it despite its malicious effect in the long-term. Your stomach intestines are a machine to process food and extract energy from it, your brain also is a processing engine. It processes information. Not all information is equally good. It may feel good but is actually junk. Most of the modern entertainment industry serves the purpose of getting your money one way or another. Those people want you to feel like you are getting something valuable(feelings, information, a lesson for life), but actually, you are not. If you get proper food and stick to a diet, your digestive system will function properly and you will be feeling good. Same goes for your brain. **In order to create something valuable, it needs to deconstruct something valuable**.

If all you get is lets plays, dumb comedies and so-so clickbaity news about celebs and crime, you are highly unlikely to produce something with better quality with your mind. There is a lot of stuff in the world you don’t yet know about: Sumerians, Lead 70-s in Italy, Enlightened monarchs, von Neumann, Claude Shannon, Dwarf Fortress, Nestor Makhno. There are better ways and better material to read, watch, play and think over than the featured stuff you are fed with by mainstream. Mainstream is oriented on the average citizen - a person with moderate views, absent taste that is not willing to get much information for consideration. Their expected audience expects for most of the a-ha moments to be chewed and fermented for them. It affects the depth of material, the real meaning of certain events and dumbs down ideas you may get from your media. Don’t fool yourself, seek for the source, not for the preprocessed semifabricate.

I was a bing-watcher of YouTube gaming channels, humor and TV shows for a long time. I was hooked up on Twitter and Telegram channels. I was spending most of my free time watching and reading useless stuff on the Internet. Resolving this was hard but possible. First of all you need to get yourself starving on information. Isolate yourself from usual fun and wait until you desperatly need some. Then open a book that you wanted to read for a long time, an arthouse movie a friend suggested to you, anything that looks healthier than usual. This will be start. Then fight the desire to skip back to the junk and stay on the light side. It will be worth it.

I am a software engineer and I try to be a good one. In order to do this it is important to stay focused, motivated and willing to work in the domain. History of the field is not that long, about 70 years, but it is filled up with media to learn about the way it developed. There are books written by other engineer about their life, credo, work and mission. There are people like Alan Key, Dennis Ritchie, Linus Torvalds and Simon Peyton Jones. There are films about how certain technologies started. There are blogs of people who paved the way to the current prominence of digital world. There is a lot to unpack in that history: from errors and issues in software and hardware that led to catastrophes to partly unseen and exotic ways of Computer Science in USSR, France and Sweden. There is culture around my domain and this culture is reach and worthy.

All lives are final

So, you have a resource - time and a way to use that resource - entertainment. Time is limited, your desire for entertainment is endless. It is better to plan what you will digest into your information tube the next time. Look through the watchlists, read lists, playlists of other people in order to get some aspiration. Last.fm may suit for music, Goodreads is great if you want to get some suggestions on less well-known great literature to read, for movies you can just traverse shortlists of famous awards and personal blogs of people that are not critics but love movies - some of them may suggest you pretty good directors and movies to get your spot on. You should be able to build up a journey for your free time that will make you better, enable you to know more, be more motivated, have more ideas, feel more. Set the flow, don’t stay in the flow that is dictated to you.

One of possible directions to go is an era immersion. Choose some time period like Roman Empire, Enlightenment, 60-s or 90-s in USA or other part of the world and start gathering cultural artifacts of that era. Music, movies(from that era or about it), books, biographies, art. Try to get yourself into the era and get the hang of it. It may give you a lot of inspiration and fun on the way. It is not limited to the actual history of mankind, it also may be some fictional universe like Lord of The Rings, WH40K, heck, Marvel universe also has some great and deep storylines.

Sometimes professional development also needs some motivation. There are popularly written books on the history of a lot of professions, biopics, and biographies. Knowing personalities in the field lets you wire yourself with the industry a bit closer and reflect their experience on your own. For engineers, there are tons of techno-porn in sci-fi, cyberpunk and other tech-related genres that will load you up with energy to stand up and do stuff to get the world from the screen or page closer to you. For historians, there are loads of stuff on National Geographic, YouTube and all over the internet. Web is open to you but it is useless unless you shift your focus.

No refund or return policy is provided

Also, try to get yourself out of the digital world sometimes. Transhumanism is soon to come and we will all be in the Matrix without an ability to walk under the sun having fun in the virtual reality, so you gotta enjoy the real world while you can be in one. On a serious note, our minds and bodies need a variety of activities in order to function properly. Having all your fun before the screen and your head is not the ultimate way. Cycling, other sports, low-level electronics with wires and magnifiers, carving and steelworks, there are ways to feel the same joy in the real world as you do virtually. This way you will be able to enjoy both real and virtual world pleasures not feeling too full on some side.

Most importantly - don’t divide fun and work into two different and disjoint worlds. Try to have fun when you work and get benefit while you play around. This is the same life in both cases. Make it holistic, make it worth it.

## lazy

the average person opens up Instagram a

hundred and fifty times a day but that's

by design like you said companies

probably know from product design

they're paying or putting fortunes and

to understand why we do what we do and a

variable reward don't have a me absolve

all that's exactly and so if you're

picking up the phone the first thing in

the morning the challenge is number

reasons this is a challenge first of all

there there are these four primary

brainwave states um beta is what you and

I are in right now we're awake Delta is

when you're fast asleep in between those

two states theta and alpha are extremely

important brainwave states for learning

so theta is the state right in and out

of sleep data is the state that we call

creativity when you are your most

creative or you're usually it's coming

because you're in this data state and

you know this when you're in and out of

sleep or you're close to like you're so

deep your mind goes and you come up with

ideas you know what put you in a data

state our showers you ever noticed like

when you're in the shower you come up

with some of your your best ideas and

your brain kind of drift it does because

you're in that brainwave state so a big

part of my work is taking the invisible

making it visible like I always when I

do these demonstrations I always tell

people that I I do it because I want you

to see that there's a method behind the

magic and when somebody does something

that's extraordinary

in athletics in education and technology

with the human body there's always a

trail you know his genius leaves Clues

above theta though is the state called

alpha right right below beta where

you're most aware and awake alpha is the

state of a learning accelerated learning

is the state of relaxed awareness this

is the state we go into when we meditate

because your critical mind is set aside

and you just absorb information

unconsciously you know what puts you

into an alpha state television you ever

noticed that if somebody's watching the

game or somebody's watching their

favorite TV show and you're trying to

have a conversation with them and they

literally are entranced they don't hear

you because the television programming

which might be an interesting word you

know programming and putting people into

a trance but that's the Alpha state

that's where

formation is just going inside your mind

so we train people how to learn

languages faster and learn facts better

by putting them into an alpha state a

relaxed state of awareness and we can do

that by by designed and people don't

realize this and this is the whole thing

I really think this should have been

taught back in school because school was

a great place to learn what to learn

math history science Spanish important

subjects on what to learn but how many

classes were on how to learn does that

even exist is dead know that that's why

I'm saying like how many classes were on

how to think critically how to make the

decisions how to solve problem how to

focus and concentrate how to read how to

read faster how to remember more right

even if they teach you 3 R's in school

reading writing arithmetic but what

about remembering what about recall what

about retention right

Socrates says there is no learning without remembering and that's really the basis of it all.

but I would say that knowing you're in this alpha theta state first thing in the morning you're very suggestible right and if the first thing you're
picking up is your phone. Then that really is what rewiring our brain for two things, ghe dangers that's gonna really decrease your level of
productivity and performance.

1. training you to be distracted and we talked about that every like share comment everything is just making you just pay attention everything else and rewiring your brain. So when you're having a conversation with somebody you can't even focus because you've trained your brain to do otherwise. And that's why **mindfulness** is so important. You know whether it's meditation or something else. Because it's not that I don't meditate every single day just to be at peace and and be in the Zen state. **I do
it because it's a mental exercise it improves my cognitive capabilities**. Meaning that when my mind goes somewhere else that's, the opportunity so I pull it back with my breath or visualization.I built that muscle because the basis of my work is really about taking nouns and turning them into verbs.

So what do I mean by that it's it's like so many people they wake up and say: oh I hope I have energy today or I have motivation saying things that they have right I have creativity so I could write today or make videos. Or I have memory or I focus or concentration. Those aren't things you have those are things you do and so you don't have love you do loving. Things you don't have energy you do. Things that give you energy just like that's that applies same thing with learning. You don't have focus. There's a process for doing focus. You don't have a memory. There's steps to improve your memory or to remember things better. There's not creativity. Is not something you have there's actually a process for creativity.

So you should never suffer from writer's block or anything else like that because because that's where if you're if you don't understand how you work when I was talking about self awareness and understanding ourselves. You know I think if somebody wants to improve their their esteem the self same overnight just study it study your brain like you'll get a boost of confidence and pride like instantly because it is the most incredible I don't even know. What to call it a device a supercomputer what in the whole universe.

you know it's not just about going out

to to Mars and all these other places

I'm gonna I want to go in here because

this controls what everything our

careers our income our health our

relationships you know whether or not

you get you know complete you know we

were talking about this before our

conversation here would have you know

when you're training for Ironman and

triathlons everything else is how much

of it is mental like we know like

everyone knows what to do but do they do

what they know because common sense is

not common practice and it's a **myth that knowledge is power. Knowledge has a potential to be power. It only becomes power when we use it when we apply.**

It like people

think they should get points for buying

books and sitting on the shelf and it

just sits there and becomes like shelf

help not self-help right or somebody

will go and learn something I listen to

a podcast like this or show or they'll

go to a conference

they'll pay all this money but they

don't do anything with what they learn

and part of it also is because they

forget it you know everyone knows

there's a learning curve but there's

also forgetting curve

did you know like **the forgetting curve says that if you learn something once within 48 hours 80% of it is gone**.

80% so you listen to a show you watch

something you on YouTube you go to a

conference you read a book within two

days the majority of it's gone because

nobody trains us how to have that's why

the memory is so important

you know and so this first thing don't

touch your phone cuz it's training you

to be distracted

2. it's training you rewiring your brain to be reactive reactive. Meaning that you're in this relaxed state of awareness when you first wake up. You pick up your phone. You get one text that with bad news or one voicemail one email and you know this. We've all still happen to us. You're in a bad mood for the rest of your day. Because you're so impressionable. You're in that hypnotic state and it affects you and you can never have a quality life. You know with that. You know and be the best version of ourselves. Be elite mental performer or high performer when you're responding and reacting everybody else.

You know my friend Brendon Burchard says **an inbox is nothing but a convenient organizational system for other people's agenda for your life** and how can you have vision for your life. Like for me the night before like I have I did a whole episode on my morning routine like **ten things I do every morning that jumpstart my brain** and I also have **an evening one-hour routine to get into sleep to maximize my sleep sleep**. It's so very important to be able to do but one of the processes I do.

Besides you know blackout curtains and cold and temperatures and breath and stuff meditation is. I don't touch a screen right because it creates blue light. And you and most people should know this every you know the screen on your laptop your phone everything else emits this blue light which inhibits melatonin production which helps you to relax and go to sleep sand those screens.

but the other thing I do is I **write down the three things I want to complexed day personally and the other three are professionally**. So now when I wake up I have a vision for my life. This is a **win** today if I just get these three things done personally and three things professionally. And when it comes to my phone **I don't touch my phone until I get at least one thing done**. And that's my test you know. If I could just do that and it's not always perfect you know but it's about progress right. Because practice makes progress alright. And there's never gonna be a perfect. And I think people need to find what works for them.

But I would say again to step out is not don't trust yourself as the

expert instead of somebody else and test

it you know maybe for one week keep your

phone outside your bedroom for just one

week and don't touch it for the first

hour a day and spend the first hour day

being a thermostat

vomiter because a thermometer what it

what's a function it reacts to the

environment and that's a--that's a kind

of crappy way to like live not that we

don't we do react in by we react to the

weather right we react to how clients

treat us we react but to the degree

we're happy is that we have the locus

that have the the location of control

inside right all the studies show that

the happiest people are the ones that

feel like they have the control over

their or their happiness and now put it

to somebody else

a person or a place or something going

the economy or politics or anything

right so a thermometer reacts the

environment but a thermostat is

different what is that function

it sets the environment it sets a goal

is set the temperature and then the

environment raises to it and so I feel

like anyone who's attracted to your work

or to mine their thermostats because

they have a growth mindset because if

they thought things were fixed they

wouldn't watch something like this

because what's the point it's just all

predestined and it's set and we can't

grow

you
