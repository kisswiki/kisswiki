- https://www.knifeart.com/s30vvss35vn.html

s30v is avaialable on leatherman charge+ tti.

https://txtoolcrafters.com/ used to offer s30v for wave and other models https://forum.multitool.org/index.php?topic=73484.0

## Jigsaw Blade Holder

Surge has Blade Exchanger with T-shank Jigsaw Blade Holder.

T-shank is better than U-shank found in Gerber https://forum.multitool.org/index.php?topic=52735.0

You can buy Jigsaw Blade Holder for Wave https://www.shapeways.com/product/JVHF3S7MG/jigsaw-blade-holder-lm-wave-charge-multitools but:

> The Leatherman tool interface is definitely the weakest point and can't be made any stronger due to space limitations in the Leatherman tool itself.

Bosh has T-shank Jig Saw Blades which fir with Surge

## Screwdriver

Surge:

- Large Screwdriver
- Small Screwdriver
- Large Bit Driver

Wave+ and Charge+ TTi:

- Large Screwdriver
- Large Bit Driver
- Small Bit Driver 

## Spring-action

Sidekick has

- Spring-action Needlenose Pliers
- Spring-action Regular Pliers
- Spring-action Wire Cutters

But this spring-action effect is not too strong.

But it seems Wave is much better than Sidekick https://www.edcforums.com/threads/help-with-purchasing-my-first-leatherman-sidekick-or-a-wave.133375.

## Signal

Adventure:

- diamond coated sharpener for maintaining your straight and serrated blade
- fire-starting ferro rod
- an emergency whistle
- awl
- clip
- hammer
- lighter and longer than Wave so easier to carry in a pocket

Signal has worse screwdriver - cannot close handle.

Clip can be purchased for Wave.

Great for whittling and other utilitarian tasks. However, with serrations over half its 2.7-inch length, it majorly fails at big knife jobs that are common outdoors.

If you spend a lot of time outdoors, you’ll want a strong fixed-blade knife, a [real ferro rod](https://www.amazon.com/Schrade-SCHFS1-Large-Striker-Lanyard/dp/B00IA933MU) and an [actual knife sharpener](https://gizmodo.com/leatherman-signal-review-can-this-multitool-survive-1738360340). And with those items, a smaller, lighter tool makes more sense for little gear repairs or the occasional need to turn a screw. In that role, the [Leatherman PS4](https://www.amazon.com/Leatherman-831195-Squirt-Black-Keychain/dp/B0032Y2OT6) excels, actually giving you a wider toolset (scissors!) in a much smaller package. If you need a tool that can come along on a plane ride, the [Style PS](https://www.amazon.com/Leatherman-831488-Style-PS-Multi-Tool/dp/B0058RX9NU) is nearly as capable.

If you want to carry a full-size multitool outdoors, around the ranch or on the job site, the cheaper Leatherman Rebar would be a better option and still gives you those replaceable cutter blades.

But, if you’re looking for a gift to give a Boy Scout or someone who geeks out on survival television, then the Signal should sate their multi-purpose fantasies. But I bet they’re secretly wishing for a Tread.
