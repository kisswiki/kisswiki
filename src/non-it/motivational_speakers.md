Motivational speakers write books and do TedTalks. They share a bag of resources that at most amount to 52 ideas-one a week. These notions are printed on individual cards and put into a spinning cylinder ala those used in old lotteries. The author is allowed to select about 8 of the cards and prepare the inspirational book, the TedTalk or motivational speech. In whichever production they choose they cite other individuals that are their peers. They also cite personal stories that cannot be found in their notes because this would be the first time they were discussed. They are anecdotal and anonymous.

Greg McKeown and his book are a product of that formula. It is self-aggrandizing in the fashion of false modesty. The style is easy to spot just as the book itself is in the big box stores like Barnes & Noble. The 8 or so concepts are parsed as if they were concrete instructions but with a somewhat whimsical style as if the author is smiling serenely when presenting those instructions. They are ordered and neat.

The author makes the case for the few relatively simple ideas as if they are a new manna, a second chance to re-invigorate the life of the reader. Then they repeat the various mantras they are espousing in many ways. Not only is the concept repeated textually but also in various graphics. Those are extraordinary in their simplicity even to the extent of being condescending to their subjects.

There are also the inane graphics and tables that offer false, black and white options. Would rather step on a nail or have your children lead exciting lives? Statements in oversized and emboldened font are assuring that the message will eternally be emblazoned in the subjects mind. Simplified adages abound as well for instance: “There are three things that few people know” or “To do this won’t always be easy but it is worth it in the end” or “You’ll be respected more as a result of your changed style”.

I am sure that Human Resource Departments everywhere are ordering the books and/or sending key staff to the seminar about the book. I also have to give the author his due in this regard. I bought the digital version for its title without doing a bit of research into what it actually was. He has earned his “gotcha” for that but I am a little wiser now.

The reason that the title allured me is because at this stage of life as my career draws to a close and a major cross country move looms, I have been doing what I can to get rid of the clutter in my life. I imagined incorrectly that this book would provide some insight. I should have considered not judging a book by its cover rather than the actual objective betterment of my own getting rid of clutter has provided. So McKeown got my 15 cents in residuals and in that regard he wins.

While it was written in a bubbly and inspirational way, I think any objective thinker with self-pride would prefer electro-shock therapy to the remedies proffered by the author and this book. While I read it I could not help to think that if I ever needed to ignite a gag reflex I would no longer have to use a finger but rather just evoke motivational notions from this book.
