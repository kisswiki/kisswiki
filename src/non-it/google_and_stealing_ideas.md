As a former insider, I can tell you likely pre-story which might cast a different light on this:
- Google employee comes up with an idea.
- They go and research the idea to check if there are any already existing companies which do it.
- If any are found, they meet and decide if they should buy the company, reinvent the idea, or that it isn't relevant.
- If, after investigation it is determined the company's tech isn't good enough, they will re-invent. Google has fairly strict tech requirements (no php, no shady licenses/ownership, no pirated stuff, etc.), so many companies don't pass.
- When they reinvent, they will do it "clean room" - ie. none of the people who reviewed the original company will be involved in the re-invention.
