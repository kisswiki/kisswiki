As a former insider, I can tell you likely pre-story which might cast a different light on this:
- Google employee comes up with an idea.
- They go and research the idea to check if there are any already existing companies which do it.
- If any are found, they meet and decide if they should buy the company, reinvent the idea, or that it isn't relevant.
- If, after investigation it is determined the company's tech isn't good enough, they will re-invent. Google has fairly strict tech requirements (no php, no shady licenses/ownership, no pirated stuff, etc.), so many companies don't pass.
- When they reinvent, they will do it "clean room" - ie. none of the people who reviewed the original company will be involved in the re-invention.

It sheds light on the captive mindset of someone inside Google. All it takes to get someone to go along with theft and underhandedness is to dress up the whole thing in bureaucratic process.
