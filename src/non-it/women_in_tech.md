How the hell did this article make it onto techmene?!

“Nobody wants to think of themselves as being sexist.” lol oh the irony. This is one of the most sexist articles I have ever read.

“I’m not the stereotypical male programmer in his early 20s looking to “work hard, play hard”.” Thanks for publicly stating you believe in the stereotype that any male programmer is just a frat brogrammer.

“If tech culture is going to change, everyone needs to change, especially men and most especially leaders.” Ah yes, of course its #allmen that need to change, because any sexist males in the workplace obviously mean they’re all sexist.

“Don’t rely on self-nominations or self-evaluations” So you’re saying because women aren’t as confident as men (also sexist), they need to be given everything even when they don’t ask?!

“A culture that rewards facetime and encourages people to regularly stay late or eat dinner at the office puts employees with families at a disadvantage (particularly mothers),” Ah yes, those evil companies who want their employees to actually work hard & be devoted to their job, what an obscene concept! & of course you say mothers especially should be given special treatment, forget fathers though, they don’t need to spend time with their children right? Way to push the women should be at home taking care of children narrative Rachel.

“A note on racial bias” ah yes, now it’s clear you are just a sjw, you’re saying only white males are given advantages, when companies literally have to hire certain amounts of females or non white ethnicity, forget hiring based on talent & treating everyone equal, we must give special treatment to everyone without a white dick! That’s really equal Rachel.

“I’m currently teaching software development at all-women Hackbright Academy,”

Lol this is the best one, you won’t even teach any males, how the hell is that not discrimination? You don’t want to teach everyone? Aren’t you just perpetuating that women need separate schooling & getting them used to “women vs men” Wouldn’t be a crazy concept to idk, teach ANYONE who wants to learn? Teach them it doesnt matter what you look like/come from, being “good at computers” is an intellectual pursuit, its actually one of the few industries that allow you to based solely on the work you put out, instead of how strong/attractive,ect you are. People don’t see the face behind the programs their using, they are solely based on the functionality they do or don’t provide.

“I mean truly have the opportunity, without implicit or explicit discrimination”. Thanks for the laugh Rachel, I mean you are literally doing the opposite of the things you claim. It is true there are a lot of sexist males & females in the industry, hell in any industry or any walk of life there will always be shit people. But its really lazy & sad you blame all men for this issue, & continue to segregate & treat women differently, instead of trying to promote equality & focus on technolgy, & the fact that anyone can be great behind an internet connected computer, regardless of their appearance.

Thanks for the great read rachel, & reminding me that sexism really does still exist.

Btw it’s obvious why you are so sour & blame men for the way you feel & why you think you have been discriminated against.

You use your gender as an excuse as to why you’re not youre in a better position, yet your only qualifications are a phd. Where are the products you created? Do you really have any other talents besides being a college graduate? Why do you think you deserve so much more because of whats between your legs?

I hope to live in a world where the tech workforce is solely judged on the products & services they put out, instead of their appearance, sex, ethnicity, ect, all those things that have nothing to do with making great tools that push humans forward.
