The real threat of quantum computers is not the testing of prime numbers, but the factoring of semiprime numbers (numbers that have two distinct prime factors). The difficulty of taking a semiprime number and extracting itâ€™s prime factors is considered an extremely hard problem, and this assumption of difficulty underpins nearly all of our modern cryptographic systems. If it were trivial to factor a large semiprime, one could intercept/hack all credit card transactions. This is the quintessential problem that quantum supremacy raises, and the most publicized; OP was remarking that the journalists likely meant to talk about this threat, but somewhat sloppily wrote prime instead of semiprime.
