I keep my prediction that there will be exactly zero fully autonomous Tesla's in 2020, and most likely 2021, 2022 and at least 2023. I would not expect anything really usable by 2025 and that is only given that somebody finally makes a scientific breakthrough. If that fundamental shift does not happen, chances are self driving cars will remain a pipe dream for a few decades or more (aside maybe from some heavily geofenced, low speed local services, such as for example at a university campus).
