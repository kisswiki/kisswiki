What the article describes is called an "expert system" and is what AI in the enterprise used to look like.
Basically, you try to capture the instinct of a great salesmen by formalizing it into computer logic.

Often that's done with rules like in the article.

It works good, but has its limits. The finer reasoning of human judgement are often not expressable, people don't know why they made that decision. Making it hard to capture. And human also have their limits. Too many variables, too much noise, too much data and they won't make the best prediction/decision.

That's when ML shines. Instead of trying to encode an expert's intuition, instead you let the machine develop its own intuition, itself becoming an expert through training.

The downside is it now similarly becomes challenging to formalize the machine's intuition. Why it made a given choice is no longer easily apparent.

I do think expert systems still have value. Especially when you lack the dataset to train a machine expert.
