## History

> PageRank meant the system was less easily gamed and produced higher quality results. The real magic was combining that with their revolutionary data center operations and being able to treat a whole lab of machines as a single device which ran via map/reduce.
The clean design helped as well but it was incremental. Google's advantage was that they produced better results faster with lower operating costs. Better and faster were good for customers. Then the rollout of relevant ads meant that Google could turn a profit even at lower cpm than competitors and their ads didn't have to be intrusive or distracting. The combination put them on much surer footing than their competitors so they kept growing, increasing revenue and profit while their competitors struggled.
