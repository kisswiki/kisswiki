`Menu > Tools > AutoCorrect > Options > Capitalize first letter of every sentence`.

If you cannot see the menu, you need to go to `Options (top gear icon) > User Interface > Single Toolbar`.

I could not enable menu in `Tabbed` user interface.

To go back to tabbed interface: `Menu > View > User Interface > Tabbed`.
