## Block Storage

> Volumes are units of highly available block storage that you can attach to your Droplet - use them to store assets, backups, databases, and more. Volumes can be moved between Droplets and you can increase their size as needed.

> DigitalOcean Block Storage is a flexible, convenient way of managing additional storage for your DigitalOcean Droplets. Block Storage is provisioned in units known as volumes. Volumes function as block devices, meaning they appear to the operating system as locally attached storage drives which can be partitioned and formatted according to your needs.
> Block Storage is a good solution in scenarios where you need more storage space, but do not require the additional processing power or memory that a larger Droplet would provide. Block Storage volumes can be created, destroyed, or expanded easily as your needs change, simplifying initial planning around your storage requirements.
