The concept of namespace isolation and resource governance related to OSs has been around for a long time, going back to BSD Jails, Solaris Zones and even the basic UNIX chroot (change root) mechanism. However, by creating a common toolset, packaging model and deployment mechanism, Docker greatly simplified the containerization and distribution of applications that can then run anywhere on any Linux host. This ubiquitous technology not only simplifies management by offering the same management commands against any host, it also creates a unique opportunity for seamless DevOps. From a developerâ€™s desktop to a testing machine to a set of production machines, a Docker image can be created that will deploy identically across any environment in seconds. This story has created a massive and growing ecosystem of applications packaged in Docker containers, with DockerHub, the public containerized-application registry that Docker maintains, currently publishing more than 180,000 applications in the public community repository.  Additionally, to guarantee the packaging format remains universal, Docker recently organized the Open Container Initiative (OCI), aiming to ensure container packaging remains an open and foundation-led format, with Microsoft as one of the founding members.
