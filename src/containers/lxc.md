> LXC is a system container runtime designed to execute “full system containers”, which generally consist of a full operating system image. An LXC process, in most common use cases, will boot a full Linux distribution such as Debian, Fedora, Arch, etc, and a user will interact with it similarly to how they would with a Virtual Machine image.
> LXC may also be used to run (but not download) application containers, but this use requires more understanding of low-level operating system details and is a less common practice. LXC can download “full system container” images from various public mirrors and cryptographically verify them. LXC does not have a central daemon and can integrate with init systems such as upstart and systemd.
