`import !== require`. You can think of it like this.

`import * as ...` imports the entire namespace. These are roughly equivalent.

```javascript
import * as React from 'react';

const React = require( 'react' );
```

`import { ... }` imports specific named exports from the namespace, roughly like destructuring.

```
import { createElement } from 'react';

const { createElement } = require( 'react' );
// or
const createElement = require( 'react' ).createElement;
```

`import ...` imports the default export, which is just a named export with the special name default. It's just some sugar for `import { default as ... }`.

```
import React from 'react';
// or
import { default as React } from 'react';

const { default: React } = require( 'react' );
// or
const React = require( 'react' ).default;
```
