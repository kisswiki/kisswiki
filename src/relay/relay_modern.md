  ## dynamic queries not possible?

  Very nice article showing some troubles Iâ€™ve also ran into. One thing is still not clear to me. How do I do dynamic queries? I have a model with almost hundreds atributes plus additional user defined fields and I would like to show them in a table view with the possibility to fetch and show only subset of those attributes.
