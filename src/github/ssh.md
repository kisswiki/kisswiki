## keygen

### Generate

Set the HOME environment variable pointing to `%USERPROFILE%` for ssh to pick it up. This usually seems to be the [problem](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9513712/git-ssh-client-for-windows-and-wrong-path-for-ssh-config-file/21451748#21451748) for many unix solutions that run on windows. Then:

`ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/github_rsa`

copy to clipboard

`clip < ~/.ssh/github_rsa.pub`

### ssh config

Add entry in file `~/.ssh/config` (`~` means home directory)

```
Host *.github.com github.com
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github_rsa
```

### Test

```
ssh -T git@github.com
ssh -T git@gist.github.com
```
