## gist

- [Fenced code blocks inside ordered and unordered lists](https://gist.github.com/clintel/1155906)
- Secret gists don't count as private repositories. You can create as many secret gists as you like.

  Warning: Secret gists aren't private. If you send the URL of a secret gist to a friend, they'll be able to see it. However, if someone you don't know discovers the URL, they'll also be able to see your gist. [link](https://help.github.com/articles/about-gists/)
- gist.github.com supports search. So you can search your gist. I use #hashtag in description, so I can search my gist by tags via myusername #tag [link](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2082723/how-do-you-manage-your-gists-on-github/5537451#5537451)
- Issues and pull requests with task list items defined will summarize the task list on the pull request listing and any cross reference [link](https://github.com/blog/1375%0A-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments)
- [What You Can Do With Gists on Github?](http://www.labnol.org/internet/github-gist-tutorial/28499/)
  - publish gist as a standalone web page using http://roughdraft.io
  - save the Gist as index.html and then use http://bl.ocks.org to serve the rendered version
  - save text snippets from web pages as public or private gists
  - embed any Gist in your web pages
  - use Google Analytics to measure the traffic to your Gists
- [gist](https://github.com/defunkt/gist) - upload content from command line to https://gist.github.com/
