> Both BSD and Apache licenses are permissive. You can use code licensed under either license to create code licensed under a different one (or one of the above, or even both).

## copyleft vs permissive

> Copyleft licenses require the derivative works or modified versions of existing software to be released under the same license.
> The Apache License doesn’t have any such requirements. It’s a permissive license.
> It permits you to release the modified parts of the code under any license of your choice.
> However, you are required to release all the unmodified parts of the software under the same license (the Apache License).
> Additionally, every licensed file must contain any original copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices in its redistributed code. Each modified file must also contain a notice about all the changes made to the original file.
>
> The Apache License is also a permissive license. However, it has stringent terms when it comes to modifications. It requires you to explicitly list out all the modifications that you’ve done in the original software, i.e., you’re required to preserve modification notices. The Apache License also states clearly that you can’t name your product in any way that hints at the product being endorsed by Apache. So you can call your product “SuperWonderServer powered by Apache” but not “Apache SuperWonderServer”. The MIT license doesn’t impose any such terms.
The MIT license is also gaining popularity with developers due to its short and clear license agreement, in contrast to the Apache license agreement. Although the Apache License is nearly identical in terms of what you can and can't do, it is much more heavily "lawyered" and is significantly more verbose. Heck, the appendix alone, which explains how to apply the license, is longer than the entire MIT license.

> 7. What is the difference between Apache License 2.0 and BSD?
> The key differences between the two licenses are:
Explicit grant of patent rights: Apache License 2.0 explicitly lays down the grant of patent rights while using, modifying or distributing Apache licensed software; it also lists the circumstances when such grant gets withdrawn.
Clear definitions of the used concepts: Apache License 2.0 explicitly defines all the terms and concepts that it uses. This leaves little scope for ambiguity.
Reusable without rewording: Apache License 2.0 can be easily used by other projects without any rewording in the license document itself.

> MIT has a killer failing: it was developed prior to the onset of software patents, and so has no patent release. This dooms it to being appropriate for only trivial projects. It doesn't matter if you think there's nothing patentable in your code: others don't know that. If you want people to use your code in this day and age, a patent release is critically important.
Use Apache. Why be concerned about license length? Include the license once and then refer to it in your source copies. No big deal.

## MPLv2

## MIT

> It’s no secret many individuals and also companies use the MIT license, because it is one of the most permissive free software licenses. With MIT you can do whatever you like, you only need to make sure you’re following this one rule: add a copy of the original MIT license and copyright notice to it.
