> MIT has a killer failing: it was developed prior to the onset of software patents, and so has no patent release. This dooms it to being appropriate for only trivial projects. It doesn't matter if you think there's nothing patentable in your code: others don't know that. If you want people to use your code in this day and age, a patent release is critically important.
Use Apache. Why be concerned about license length? Include the license once and then refer to it in your source copies. No big deal.

## MIT

> It’s no secret many individuals and also companies use the MIT license, because it is one of the most permissive free software licenses. With MIT you can do whatever you like, you only need to make sure you’re following this one rule: add a copy of the original MIT license and copyright notice to it.
