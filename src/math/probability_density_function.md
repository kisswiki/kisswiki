> A probability density essentially says "for a given variable (e.g. radius) what, at that particular value, is the likelihood of encountering an event or an object (e.g. an electron)?"
> So if I'm at the nucleus of a atom and I move to, say, one Angstrom away, at one Angstrom there is a certain likelihood I will spot an electron.
> But we like to not just ask for the probability at one point; we'd sometimes like to find the probability for a range of points: What is the probability of finding an electron between the nucleus and one Angstrom, for example.
> So we add up ("integrate") the probability from zero to one Angstrom.
> For the sake of convenience, we sometimes employ "normalization"; that is, we require that adding up all the probabilities over every possible value will give us 1.00000000 (etc).
