polynomial is an expression consisting of variables (or indeterminates) and coefficients, that involves only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents of variables. An example of a polynomial of a single indeterminate `x` is `x^2 − 4x + 7`. An example in three variables is `x^3 + 2xyz^2 − yz + 1`.
