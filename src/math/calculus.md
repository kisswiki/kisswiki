Newton was describing the orbits of planets around the sun, and mentioned that he suspected the orbits were not perfectly circular, but elliptical. A friend colleague of his was unfazed by his assertions. 

"Prove it" said the colleague.

And Newton shut himself up for two three days trying to come up with a mathematical proof for his theory. He had to invent calculus to do so. Which he did :)

A little fun fact, calculus is the latin word for stones. I think it was because stones were used to physically express growth in the place of graphs with gradients.

The fact that planets orbits were elliptical and not circular was known more than 30 years before Newton's birth. It was discovered by Johannes Kepler. So the "invention" of calculus had in fact nothing to do with this, and many bases of calculus where discovered by Leibniz

Calculus came about because of Newton's discovery of the binomial theorem (http://www.khanacademy.org/math/trigonometry/polynomial_and_rational/binomial_theorem/v/binomial-theorem--part-1) in 1665. This led to his development of theories on optics, the laws of gravitation, and infinitesimal calculus over the course of two years away from school because of the spread of bubonic plague.
