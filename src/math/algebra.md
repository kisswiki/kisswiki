The term "algebra" is derived from the name of one of the basic operations with equations (al-jabr, meaning "restoration", referring to adding a number to both sides of the equation to consolidate or cancel terms) described in this book.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_Musa_al-Khwarizmi

Algebra (from Arabic "al-jabr" meaning "reunion of broken parts"[1])

Elementary algebra differs from arithmetic in the use of abstractions, such as using letters to stand for numbers that are either unknown or allowed to take on many values.

In its most general form, algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols
