In mathematics, an equation is a statement of an equality containing one or more variables. Solving the equation consists of determining which values of the variables make the equality true.

There are two kinds of equations: identity equations and conditional equations. An identity equation is true for all values of the variable. A conditional equation is true for only particular values of the variables.

Each side of an equation is called a member of the equation.[citation needed] Each member will contain one or more terms. The equation,

`Ax^2+Bx+C=y`

has two members: `Ax^2+Bx+C` and `y`. The left member has three terms and the right member one term. The variables are `x` and `y` and the parameters are `A`, `B`, and `C`.

While individual equations present a kind of puzzle and have been considered throughout history, the formulation of general theories of Diophantine equations (beyond the theory of quadratic forms) was an achievement of the twentieth century.
