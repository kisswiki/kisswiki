In mathematics, an equation is a statement of an equality containing one or more variables. Solving the equation consists of determining which values of the variables make the equality true.

There are two kinds of equations: identity equations and conditional equations. An identity equation is true for all values of the variable. A conditional equation is true for only particular values of the variables.

Each side of an equation is called a member of the equation.[citation needed] Each member will contain one or more terms. The equation,

`Ax^2+Bx+C=y`

has two members: `Ax^2+Bx+C` and `y`. The left member has three terms and the right member one term. The variables are `x` and `y` and the parameters are `A`, `B`, and `C`.

An equation is analogous to a scale into which weights are placed. When equal weights of something (grain for example) are place into the two pans, the two weights cause the scale to be in balance and are said to be equal. If a quantity of grain is removed from one pan of the balance, an equal amount of grain must be removed from the other pan to keep the scale in balance. Likewise, to keep an equation in balance, the same operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division must be performed on both sides of an equation for it to remain an equality.

In geometry, equations are used to describe geometric figures. As equations that are considered, such as implicit equations or parametric equations have infinitely many solutions, the objective is now different: instead of given the solutions explicitly or counting them, which is impossible, one uses equations for studying properties of figures. This is the starting idea of algebraic geometry, an important area of mathematics.

Algebra studies two main families of equations: polynomial equations and, among them the special case of linear equations. Polynomial equations have the form P(x) = 0, where P is a polynomial. Linear equations have the form ax + b = 0, where a and b are parameters.

The "=" symbol, which appears in every equation, was invented in 1557 by Robert Recorde, who considered that nothing could be more equal than parallel straight lines with the same length.

## Equal etymology

 from Latin aequalis "uniform, identical, equal," from aequus "level, even, flat; as tall as, on a level with; friendly, kind, just, fair, equitable, impartial; proportionate; calm, tranquil," which is of unknown origin.

## Circle equation

An equation involving x and y as unknowns and the parameter R might be:

`x^2+y^2=R^2`

When R is chosen to have the value of two (R = 2), this equation would be recognized, when sketched in Cartesian coordinates, as the equation for a particular circle with a radius of two. Hence, the equation with R unspecified is the general equation for the circle.

let's work out exactly where all the points are.

We make a right-angled triangle.

And then use Pythagoras `x^2 + y^2 = 5^2`.

There are an infinite number of those points.

In all cases a point on the circle follows the rule `x^2 + y^2 = radius^2`.

## Diophantine equation

While individual equations present a kind of puzzle and have been considered throughout history, the formulation of general theories of Diophantine equations (beyond the theory of quadratic forms) was an achievement of the twentieth century.
