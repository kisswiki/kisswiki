It is correct that you don't need a math degree to detect data b.s.
However, the suggested "red flag" method is only part of the solution. You learn to detect the red flags and you understand, if red flags accumulate, to start worrying about the truthness of what you are presented...
and then you hit a bullshitter or lyier who, through skill or pure luck, starts validating things that you know are probably wrong but really really hope to be true. And suddenly you yourself start to support the b.s. thesis because you really want it to be true. Then, what do red flags help you? You will actively try to invalidate them. They may stay objectively true, but in our poorly structured, limited way of thinking, they won't.
The true art of survival is to detect when something is pulling your inner optimist. You need to learn to recognize when this guy wakes up. And when he wakes up you need to assume that you are being cheated, that someone is actively trying to sell you something you wouldn't buy otherwise. Because if there is a person with malicious intend all other ways of thinking will make him win. But if it's just coincidence it doesn't hurt to protect yourself.

Once you understand Simpson's Paradox and Anscombe's Quartet, you will simply never believe any statistics that anyone shows you ever. Infact you will probably never even believe your own calculations, and that's a good thing if it keeps you on your toes.

Calling BS on big data is really important, but this article is weak. The New Yorker should be doing better. Try Weapons of Math Destruction by Cathy O'Neill for a much more informed critique.
