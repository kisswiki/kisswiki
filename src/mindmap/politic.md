- left
  - redefine terms and misrepresent arguments
    - Everything about the left's rhetorical strategy is to redefine terms and misrepresent the argument to make themselves look like the good guys, or the victims, even in blatant opposition to reality. If you're against illegal immigration, they say you're against all immigration. If you're not racist and judge people as individuals, you're now racist because you don't give special support to people of certain groups based on race. Social justice instead of real justice, men and women are just social constructs, "living wage," anything they arbitrarily want becomes a "human right." The political right has plenty of its own problems, but right now, it's a total clown world over on the left. http://9gag.com/gag/aAGnNwL#cs_comment_id=c_166233076325701554
