  - Heart of metal pen: I ordered this pen few days ago and... I'm in love with this pen. In my opinion this is the best pen for Supernote. This pen is better than the standard. Is more premium (also more expensive), the materials are nice and it looks so nicely if you are an employee. It's heavy (quite similar than the standard one) but more ergonomic. If you use it without the pen's cap, you It'll be thinner. The feeling when you are writting is amazing. https://www.reddit.com/r/Supernote/comments/m3n0tn/my_experience_about_pens_for_supernote_which_one/
