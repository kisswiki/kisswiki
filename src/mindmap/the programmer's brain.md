- confusion
  - knowledge
    - LTM
      - long term memory
        - lack of knowledge - issue in LTM
          - LTM is like hard drive
  - information
    - STM
      - short term memory
        - lack of information - issue in STM
          - STM is like RAM
  - processing power
    - working memory
      - lack of processing power - issue in working memory
        - processor of the brain
  - all 3 processes are at work while reading code
    - the complement each other
- speed reading
  - STM
    - 30 seconds
      - stores for 30 seconds
        - after 30 seconds you have to store it in LTM
          - or it will be lost forever
    - 2 to 6
      - can store from 2 to 6 elements
  - chunking
    - helps overcoming size limits of STM
  - what helps
    - design patterns
    - high-level comments
    - low-level like "decrement"
      - create a burden
    - beacons
      - part of program
      - help understand what a program does
      - narrows your hypothesis
      - confirm or refute hypothesis about the source
      - types
      - simple
        - like variable names, class names, method names
      - compound
        - self.left and self.right
          - form a compound beacon
        - `for` can be a compound beacon
          - because contains
            - variable
            - initial assignment
            - increment
            - boundary values
      - smaller than chunks
      - expert programmers, but not novices
        - make havy use of beacons
