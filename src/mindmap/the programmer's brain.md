- confusion
  - knowledge
    - LTM
      - long term memory
        - lack of knowledge - issue in LTM
          - LTM is like hard drive
  - information
    - STM
      - short term memory
        - lack of information - issue in STM
          - STM is like RAM
  - processing power
    - working memory
      - lack of processing power - issue in working memory
        - processor of the brain
  - all 3 processes are at work while reading code
    - the complement each other
- speed reading
  - design patterns
  - high-level comments
    - low-level like "decrement"
      - create a burden
  - beacons
    - part of program
      - help understand what a program does
    - narrows your hypothesis
      - confirm or refute hypothesis about the source
    - types
      - simple
        - like variable names
      - compound
        - self.left and self.right
          - form a compound beacon
        - `for` can be a compound beacon
          - because contains
            - variable
            - initial assignment
            - increment
            - boundary values
