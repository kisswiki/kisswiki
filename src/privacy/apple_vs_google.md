his has been my stance for about five years now. I don’t want to give all this info to companies I don’t trust. Apple devices might cost more, but Apple only makes money from you when you give them money. Google and Facebook make money when you give them money and then make money when you give them information too. There’s a perverse incentive, they want you to use it more and give them more information because they make more money from selling you rather than selling to you.
If you want that to change, you have to be willing to offset that price difference from your own wallet.


What? Apple handed over ALL their user data in China over to the government for a buck versus Google fought back and left.

Then removed the VPN software and cut their users off at the knees from being able to protect themselves. While the way to keep your data private in China is use Google Fi.

Have to look past marketing and what is real.

My biggest grip is Apple terms allow them to have a ton of your data but there is no transparency like with Google.

Google provides a dashboard with everytthing in one place were you can remove and download. Nothing similar from Apple.

So when I share my location with imessages how do I remove that? Where can I see it? Google is far better.


Apple has ads. Have you read their ToS / privacy policy?
