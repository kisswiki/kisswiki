## About

>YES! We don’t need to look much further back than the desktop/laptop platform to see what happens… web apps and the cloud take over. Almost nobody installs applications anymore, and even the stubborn creative suites and word processing programs have moved off of our hard drives.
It won’t be long before this same thing happens with mobile devices as they get more capable with web views.
One great example of an app done this way is The Financial Times https://ft.com, using local storage to make the experience exceptional.
