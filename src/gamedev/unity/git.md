Those two were already set when I've created project in Unity:

`Edit > Project Settings > Version Control > Mode > Visible Meta Files`
`Edit > Project Settings > Editor > Asset Serialization > Mode > Force Text`

## .gitignore

Get .gitignore from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/main/Unity.gitignore as the one create with github.com/new is not the neweset one.

## No scene after cloning

When you open a project in Unity and Unity has to recreate the Library, it might be that the empty default scene gets loaded. Double click on your Scenes folder and open your saved scene.
