`[Serializefield]` is what is known as an attribute, it can be used to decorate a field (member variable). Attributes are placed within square brackets.

The use of this attribute is to expose the member variable within the Inspector without having to give the member variable a public access modifier, e.g. it can remain as a private member variable, not accessible to other classes.
