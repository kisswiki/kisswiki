We shipped Planetary Annihilation on Win, Mac, and Linux. Linux uses we're a big vocal part of the Kickstarter and forums.

In the end they accounted for <0.1% of sales but >20% of auto reported crashes and support tickets (most gfx driver related).

Would totally skip Linux.

The game came out in 2014
Runs OpenGL 3.0 on all platforms

The problem wasn’t the number of distros (though obviously plenty of those that were unsupported would still report issues), the problem was graphics drivers. Couldn’t just say “use X driver” because not all GPUs of even the same family would run well and not crash.

I would guess some of the issues came from the fact the UI and game ran as separate processes that passed data back and forth via the graphics systems. Not a terribly common thing to do. We also were doing virtual megatexturing which didn’t work properly on some machines.

I had the conversation often with Mac users on why VR hardware wasn't targeting the platform. Would show them benchmarks of the then maxed out $15k Mac Pro being significantly slower than the Oculus recommended spec.

Yeah, I didn't want to touch on Mac support in the original post, but Mac support also cost way more than it made in sales.

My personal thoughts are I went back to console dev so I could ignore these problems.

Windows and Mac versions were absolutely more stable. Steam can track that kind of data for devs.

Also probably cost more to add support for Mac than it made, but far less extreme of a loss. Caught most issues in house AFAIK, and just kind of trucked along without any real dev costs after shipping.

PA supported Linux natively from day one, and the current team continues to support it. Today the Linux build is apparently more stable than Windows. Continued support is very much a passion them, even knowing it may not be financially benefitial.

I would say that devs should target what Steam officially supports.

Right now that's SteamOS and Ubuntu LTS.


The Desktop Dungeons Linux numbers are super similar to the quoted post - we *lost* money doing a Linux version and it impacted our Steam reviews negatively with all the support we had to do. How is "focus on an even smaller number of buyers" going to turn that around?
