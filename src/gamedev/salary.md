>You also need to note that the gaming industry is highly volatile. There are very few programmers with more than ten years of experience who are still working in games. Job stability seems to be much worse in general. It's really easy to get applicants for game developer jobs, and retention doesn't seem highly valued. It's somewhat telling that the upper category for experience on the survey is a paltry six years.

> Why do sport stars make more money than doctors ? You are only worth what value you can bring to the table. Games exist purely for enjoyment and caters only to limited market whereas “regular” software can be applied to wide variety of settings with potential to increase profits hundred-fold( think a brick and mortar store going online to sell stuff). So, while game development and game programming is actually lot harder than “regular” software development( generally speaking), application development brings in more money and presumably higher pay and job stability to developers because the work of these developers bring more value to end users.
