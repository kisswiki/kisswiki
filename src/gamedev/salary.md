>You also need to note that the gaming industry is highly volatile. There are very few programmers with more than ten years of experience who are still working in games. Job stability seems to be much worse in general. It's really easy to get applicants for game developer jobs, and retention doesn't seem highly valued. It's somewhat telling that the upper category for experience on the survey is a paltry six years.

> Why do sport stars make more money than doctors ? You are only worth what value you can bring to the table. Games exist purely for enjoyment and caters only to limited market whereas “regular” software can be applied to wide variety of settings with potential to increase profits hundred-fold( think a brick and mortar store going online to sell stuff). So, while game development and game programming is actually lot harder than “regular” software development( generally speaking), application development brings in more money and presumably higher pay and job stability to developers because the work of these developers bring more value to end users.

>As computing and graphics power increased, so too did the size of development teams, as larger staffs were needed to address the ever-increasing technical and design complexities. The larger teams consist of programmers, artists, game designers, and producers. Their salaries can range anywhere from $50,000 to $120,000 generating large labor costs for firms producing videogames[39] which can often take between one and three years to develop. Now budgets typically reach millions of dollars despite the growing popularity of middleware and pre-built game engines. In addition to growing development costs, marketing budgets have grown dramatically, sometimes consisting of two to three times of the cost of development.

>Game developers typically make a middle-class income.  Those trying to break into the industry, especially indie developers, make hardly any money at all.  Those who are very experienced or very lucky can earn a six-figure salary, including bonuses and/or stock options; however, studios go out of business and developers get laid off so often that the high income can turn into a weekly unemployment check.

>About the only way to make a lot of money in the game industry is to have an ownership position in a company that is later purchased by another company or goes public.
