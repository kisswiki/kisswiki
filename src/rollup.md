> what makes Rollup faster is what I called "scope-hoisting" (aka "module-inlining"), i.e. the fact that every module shares the same scope instead of being loaded dynamically from separate scopes.
This means that Rollup turns multiple modules into what you would have written if you were writing one big module, and you only pay the cost of variable initialization and lookup, rather than the cost of the dynamic module loader that runs whenever require() is called.
