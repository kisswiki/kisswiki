Observables provide support for passing messages between parts of your application. They are used frequently in Angular and are a technique for event handling, asynchronous programming, and handling multiple values.

The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of state changes. This pattern is similar (but not identical) to the publish/subscribe design pattern.

Observables are declarativeâ€”that is, you define a function for publishing values, but it is not executed until a consumer subscribes to it. The subscribed consumer then receives notifications until the function completes, or until they unsubscribe.

RxJS provides an implementation of the Observable type, which is needed until the type becomes part of the language and until browsers support it. The library also provides utility functions for creating and working with observables.

Angular makes use of observables as an interface to handle a variety of common asynchronous operations. For example:

You can define custom events that send observable output data from a child to a parent component.
The HTTP module uses observables to handle AJAX requests and responses.
The Router and Forms modules use observables to listen for and respond to user-input events.
