## north star

what I’d recommend as a north star for most teams. All works happens as close to master as possible and we have no (or very few – count them on 1 hand) long term development branches other than master. People create short lived topic branches, do their work and merge to master quickly. We “branch for release” by creating a new branch for each release we ship and all the servicing work for the release happens in the release branch.
