## multiple helpers

> If there are multiple instances of the credential.helper configuration variable, each helper will be tried in turn, and may provide a username, password, or nothing. Once Git has acquired both a username and a password, no more helpers will be tried. https://git-scm.com/docs/gitcredentials

in git >=2.9:

> Since the credential.helper key is a multi-valued config list, there's no way to "unset" a helper once it's been set. So if your system /etc/gitconfig sets one, you can never avoid running it, but only add your own helpers on top.
> giving an empty string as its value now serves as the signal to clear the values specified in various files
