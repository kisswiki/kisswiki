> if we had more experienced front-end developers I would probably have pushed for React (and Redux instead of Vuex) as it's not that much harder to learn but takes a bit more experience with Js. One of the main reasons to chose React over Vue is that, It doesn't impose the limitations of a templating engine / directive. For example, as opposed to "v-if render this, v-if render that, v-for render these, etc." you can just use JSX which is like small bits of Javascript controlled Html, and get all the native control structures for free, it is very liberating. Furthermore, you can have your components' description live right besides your business logic instead of in your html.

> React will push you to become a better developer by making you think about immutability, among other FP concepts, the ecosystem really is great, solutions for novel problems, as well as best practices and anti-patterns are easy to find, documentation is better (even though Vue's really good, I found some edge cases like deep and immediate watchers buried really deep in the api), and from a management stand point React devs are easier to come around if that's a concern.

edit: So you can go both ways. .jsx files with css modules and JSX or vue files with templates and css for your single file components
