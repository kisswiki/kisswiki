Select the Docker 17.09.9-ce on 16.04 (the version numbers might be higher by the time you read this article) option and you’ll create a droplet where all the steps for installing Docker on Ubuntu 13.04 are already complete. It’s a real time-saver and lets you dive right into trying out Docker.

I actually found running more than one Docker container (I am running a WordPress stack in a container) on the $5.00 droplet too heavy.
