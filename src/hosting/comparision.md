## chargin for powered-off

Am I charged while my Droplet is in a powered-off state?
Yes. Your disk space, CPU, RAM, and IP address are all reserved while your Droplet is powered off. If you want to save a Droplet for future use take a snapshot of it and then destroy it. You'll be able to create a new Droplet from the snapshot image anytime to bring it back online. Snapshots are billed at $.05/GB/mo, so a 40GB snapshot costs $2/month.
