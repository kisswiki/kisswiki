## $2.5 plan

Their $2.50 plans are simply only available at a couple of their locations (eg Miami FL).

They could certainly do a better job of making this clearer from the start because currently the first you discover it is when you are some way into the sign-up process. A small note where they advertise this plan saying "Only available at <locations>" at minimum.
