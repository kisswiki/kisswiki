## About

> If a dedicated server is analagous to owning an entire house on the beach-front to yourself, and shared-hosting is like renting a room in the nearby hotel, then what's a VPS? It's like owning a caravan in the holiday park; you share some things like the shop and access to the beach, but mostly you have your own environment, and you're responsible for maintaining and looking after it.
