  Imagine if I asked you to learn a programming language and a culture of practices where:
  - All the variables were a single letter, pathologically so, and that a programmers enjoyed using foreign alphabets, glyph variation and fonts to disambiguate their code from meaningless gibberish.
  - None of the functions were documented independently, and instead the API documentation consisted of circular references to other pieces of similar code, often with the same names overloaded into multiple meanings, often impossible to Google.
  - None of the sample code could be run on a typical computer, in fact, most of it was pseudo-code lacking a clear definition of input and output, or even the environment and domain in which it is typically expected to be run.
  - Expressive code in this language was impossible to write in a typical text editor or word processor, and transcribing code from paper back into something useful was an error-prone process.
  - Papers describing novel idea in the field were incomprehensible by default, so that the world's most established experts on the subject would need years to decide whether a particularly cutting-edge program is meaningful or in fact insane gibberish.
  - These experts not only see nothing wrong with this picture, but in fact, revel in symbolic obscurity and ego-driven naming, dismissing sincere attempts at fixing these deep seated problems as meaningless taste arguments or pointless pop culture entertainment.  

  If you were an experienced programmer, you would rightly call me insane.  

  If you were a mathematician, it would be a day ending in y.
