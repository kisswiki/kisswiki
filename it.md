      - Cycle.js is a paradigm changer, because it is the only framework in which you can extract explicit data flow graphs from the code base. When introducing new developers to large code bases, this can make them reason about the code without looking at code. [link](https://medium.com/@fkrautwald/we-are-not-writing-much-code-5404fb7d39e)

        -  FRP has a very unique API that takes a bit to learn, even if you’ve done map/reduces before. The DSL being very unique made it harder to reuse other functions in my code base. I couldn’t reuse code but the Observable and Streams could be pasted around to leverage in other classes.
        - Merging and combining streams is where it got muddy really fast. I had events going that were hard to track down. I lost the finer grain control when more than one stream was being used.
        - Debugging FRP processes was stepping through a lot of the internals of the libraries to find where events got twisted. Using FRP in smaller more isolated uses and limiting combining streams was much more beneficial and the file size increase if you’re just using it in place of a single callback function is not very useful.
        - a pattern called CSP (...) code that looks like normal is synchronous and walks line by line acutally parks and waits until something comes across the channel before going to the next line. JavaScript will be getting this with `await` in ES2016. (...) CSP is really cool, right? Async work looks like sync work and all the code is together making it easy to rationalize about.
        - FRP functions used inside streams needed to understand they were in a stream. Functions used in a transducer don’t know they’re in a transducer. Basically I can reuse them with all my current map/reduce/filtering code inside async channel.

  -  Slaves are not allowed to say no. Laborers may be hesitant to say no. But professionals are expected to say no.  
  Indeed, good managers crave someone who has the guts to say no. It’s the only way you can really get anything done.
