# Functional programming

## FP vs OO

- The overriding difference between a functional language and a non-functional language is that functional languages don't have assignment statements

- what OO really comes down to is that OO languages replace function pointers with convenient polymorphism

## The semantic problem with hierarchies

The idea of building software on top of a tree-shaped ontology would be broken even if our knowledge fit neatly into a tree. Ontologies are not used to build the real world, they are used to describe it from observation. As we learn more, we are constantly updating our ontology, sometimes moving everything around.

In software, this is incredibly destructive: Moving everything around breaks everything.
