## head tracking

Positional tracking - placing stationary sensors away from the user to watch the movement of their head
a mobile VR headset use sensors on the phone to watch the movement of the environment.
But it turns out that achieving this with the precision necessary for virtual reality (‘sub-millimeter accuracy’ as you’ll often hear) is particularly challenging and still considered an unsolved problem.
Oculus and Samsung hadn’t achieved a viable solution by the time they wanted to ship Gear VR.
So Gear VR went out the door with rotational tracking only. Developers have been able to design around this limitation for Gear VR apps quite effectively, but it’s widely agreed that positional tracking would add significantly to the mobile VR experience.

The tracking update rate of the Oculus Rift DK2, meaning the rate at which Oculus’ tracking driver sends different position/orientation estimates to VR applications, is 1000 Hz. However, the time between updates is 2ms, meaning that the driver updates the position/orientation, and then updates it again immediately afterwards, 500 times per second.
