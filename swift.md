    - For larger apps, well, I have a Swift app that isn't really very big, probably still small but significantly bigger than a tutorial, and it keeps freezing Xcode. (Edit something in Interface Builder, switch to the ViewController class with IBOutlets in it, then switch back and forth between ViewControllers making edits. Each time it takes longer and longer until I just force-quit Xcode to avoid twiddling my thumbs for 5 minutes.) So I don't think Swift is ready for any app that isn't pretty small anyway. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10925916
    - I think the gain is mostly that Swift allows you write code which more resistant to bugs than its ObjC counterpart would be. In Yaron Minsky's "Effective ML" talk, he mentions the idea of "Make illegal states unrepresentable": https://vimeo.com/14313378 The combination of enums and non-optional variables allows you to get much closer to this ideal than you could with ObjC. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10925793
