- Rust is a new, practical, community-developed systems programming language that "runs blazingly fast, prevents almost all crashes, and eliminates data races." Rust derives from a rich history of languages to create a multi-paradigm (imperative/functional), low-level language that focuses on high-performance, zero-cost safety guarantees in concurrent programs. It began to gain traction in industry even before its official 1.0 release in May 2015, showing a recognized need for a new low-level systems language. http://cis198-2016s.github.io/
