    - Secret gists don't count as private repositories. You can create as many secret gists as you like.

      Warning: Secret gists aren't private. If you send the URL of a secret gist to a friend, they'll be able to see it. However, if someone you don't know discovers the URL, they'll also be able to see your gist. [link](https://help.github.com/articles/about-gists/)
    - gist.github.com supports search. So you can search your gist. I use #hashtag in description, so I can search my gist by tags via myusername #tag [link](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2082723/how-do-you-manage-your-gists-on-github/5537451#5537451)
