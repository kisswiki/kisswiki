My Knowledge in simple mindmap using markdown lists (mostly).

To have it autosave and push changes:

```
npm i
npm run watch
```

I edit it in atom.io
- I use commands `fold-all` and `unfold-all`
- key strokes
  - `Ctrl+[` to decrease indent and `Ctrl+]` to increase indent. Those key bindings work even when you are in the middle of line, contrary to `tab` and `Shift+Tab`.
  - `Ctrl+Alt+[` - fold current row, `Ctrl+Alt+]` - unfold current row
