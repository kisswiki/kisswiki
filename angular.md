## clear input

In angular-1.4 I can't just null model associated to input. I need to

`document.getElementById('fileupload').value = null;`

## $scope.$apply() vs $scope.$apply(fn)

If your code isnâ€™t wrapped in a function passed to $apply, and it throws an error, that error is thrown outside of AngularJS, which means any error handling being used in your application is going to miss it. $apply not only runs your code, but it runs it in a try/catch so your error is always caught, and the $digest call is in a finally clause, meaning it will run regardless of an error being thrown.

## Form

```html
<form name="form" novalidate>
  <div ng-class="{'has-error': form.description.$touched && form.description.$error.required}">
    <label>Description</label>
    <textarea required name="description"></textarea>
  </div>
  <button class="orange" ng-class="inactive: form.$invalid || form.$pending" ng-disabled="form.$invalid || form.$pending" ng-click="!(form.$invalid || form.$pending) && save()">Save</button>
</div>
```

## Touched vs pristine

- @property {boolean} $untouched True if control has not lost focus yet.
- @property {boolean} $touched True if control has lost focus.
- @property {boolean} $pristine True if user has not interacted with the control yet.
- @property {boolean} $dirty True if user has already interacted with the control.

## Disable debug to speed up

```
myApp.config(['$compileProvider', function ($compileProvider) {
  $compileProvider.debugInfoEnabled(false);
}]);
```
